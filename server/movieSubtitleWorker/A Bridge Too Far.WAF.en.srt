1
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,800
It's hard to remember now,
but Europe was like this in 1944.

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,120
The Second World War
was in its fifth year...

3
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
and still going Hitler's way.

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,280
German troops
controlled most of Europe.

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,280
D-Day changed all that.

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,640
D-Day: June 6, 1944...

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,000
when the Allied forces, under
their commander General Eisenhower...

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,320
landed on the northern
coast of France.

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,280
By July they were able
to begin their own offensive.

10
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,960
By August, Paris was liberated.

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
Everywhere the Germans retreated.

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,040
But with the Allied victories
came problems.

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,640
Supplies still had to be driven
from Normandy, over 400 miles away...

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,120
and became dangerously short.

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,360
The Allied advance
began to come to a halt.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,720
Another problem
facing Eisenhower was this:

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,200
his two most famous generals...
Patton, who was in the south...

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,880
and Montgomery in the north...
disliked each other intensely.

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,680
The longstanding rivalry
had never been more fierce.

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,120
There simply were not
enough supplies for both armies.

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,440
Each wanted to be the one
to defeat the Germans.

22
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,480
Each wanted to beat
the other to Berlin.

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,680
In September, 1944...

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,360
Montgomery devised
a new and spectacular plan...

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,520
given the code name
"Market Garden."

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,920
Eisenhower, under great pressure
from his superiors...

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,440
finally sided with Montgomery...

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,240
and Operation Market Garden
became a reality.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,440
The plan, like so many plans
in so many wars before it...

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,120
was meant to end
the fighting by Christmas...

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,000
and bring the boys back home.

32
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,840
What is that noise?

33
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,680
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.

34
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,280
The Germans have collapsed.

35
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,840
Then the war is over?

36
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,200
Soon.

37
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,800
But what is that noise?

38
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,680
Panic.

39
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,520
You may begin.

40
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,840
May I first be permitted to say,
and I think I speak for all of us...

41
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,920
how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...

42
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,760
that you have been reappointed
commander of our forces in the West.

43
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
Speeches are for
victory celebrations.

44
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,840
Let's get to the point.
Air power?

45
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,600
Air power, Field Marshal?

46
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
Briefly, please.

47
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,960
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?

48
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,640
Also minimal.

49
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,880
Tanks... Troops...
Replacements?

50
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
- Minimal.
- Morale?

51
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,880
Nonexistent.

52
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,080
What do you think
we should do?

53
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,800
End the war, you fools.

54
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,040
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.

55
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,440
We have such confidence in you.

56
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,920
Everyone knows you have
never lost a battle.

57
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm still young.
Give me time.

58
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,240
The first thing we must do...

59
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
is to turn this rabble
into something like an army.

60
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,960
Anything at all on when
they plan to invade Holland?

61
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,800
They seem to have
paused in Belgium.

62
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,840
Most likely supply problems.

63
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,840
Otherwise we can't imagine why.

64
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,080
I think it's because
we're retreating...

65
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
faster than they can advance.

66
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,520
How many vehicles
in the past hour?

67
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,920
Fifty-four.

68
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,840
And for the same hour yesterday?

69
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,120
Ninety-eight.

70
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,400
Last week your mother and I
could have captured Holland alone.

71
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
Already the panic has stopped.

72
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,640
It isn't over yet
and those idiots don't realize it.

73
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,240
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.

74
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,280
I was nine when they got here.

75
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Next month I'll be 14.
I ought to know something.

76
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,200
Father, the Allies will come?

77
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,160
But when?

78
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,160
I've just got back to England
from Brussels...

79
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,320
where I had a meeting this morning
with Field Marshal Montgomery.

80
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,720
There was an earlier one
with General Eisenhower.

81
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,800
They both feel, as I do...

82
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,600
that when the Field Marshal's plan
has succeeded...

83
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,240
we should be able
to end the war by Christmas...

84
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,280
in less than 100 days.

85
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,440
Actually, the plan
is really very simple.

86
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,960
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles,
and drop them behind enemy lines.

87
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
It'll be the largest
airborne operation ever mounted.

88
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,080
Quite frankly, this kind of thing's
never been attempted before.

89
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,880
- Where's this all going to take place?
- Holland.

90
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,840
- And when?
- I'm coming to that now.

91
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,160
Right.

92
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,160
The ground forces: 30 Corps, commanded
by General Horrocks, 20,000 vehicles.

93
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,760
And this, as you know,
is the German front line.

94
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,480
Now we're going to lay a carpet,
as it were, of airborne troops...

95
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,800
over which 30th Corps can pass.

96
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,760
We shall seize the bridges...
it's all a question of bridges...

97
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,960
with thunderclap surprise...

98
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,720
and hold them until
they can be secured.

99
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,120
Now first of all,
General Maxwell Taylor...

100
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
Eindhoven.

101
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,760
You take and hold
the bridges there with 101st.

102
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,920
General Gavin,
with your 82nd...

103
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
you get Nijmegen.

104
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,000
You take and hold the bridges.

105
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,160
And Roy, you get the prize:
Arnhem.

106
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,480
Arnhem Bridge.

107
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,440
- And you hold it.
- For how long?

108
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
Monty assures me that 30 Corps...

109
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,080
will do the 63 miles
in two days.

110
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,320
Sixty-three miles in two days.

111
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,360
- They oughta be able to handle that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,720
General Sosabowski, you go with
your Polish Brigade with Roy Urquhart.

113
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,360
I'm so sorry.

114
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,680
Roy...

115
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,600
when you've secured
your bridge...

116
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,160
and 30th Corps have got across it,
we can turn east...

117
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,000
right into the industrial heart
of Germany... the Ruhr.

118
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,440
Once we control their factories,
there's not much they can do about it.

119
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,000
And that is the plan.

120
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
And we go next Sunday.

121
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,480
Seven days?

122
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
Why not?
The sooner we go, the better.

123
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,640
We've got them on the run.

124
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,880
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?

125
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
- I've said nothing.
- Precisely.

126
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,880
Your silences are thunderous.

127
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
General Browning, I...

128
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,880
I am a Pole...

129
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,040
considered by some
to be smart.

130
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,760
If that is so...

131
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,800
it makes me member
of a true minority group.

132
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,280
Minority groups
are more comfortable in silence.

133
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,480
I should have thought the opposite
was true. But you do disapprove?

134
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,320
I am thrilled that your great Field
Marshal Montgomery has devised a plan.

135
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,600
I promise you, I'll be
properly ecstatic if it works.

136
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,640
When it works.

137
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,240
Of course.
When it works.

138
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,840
Thank you.

139
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,480
Well, now let's
get down to the details.

140
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
First we shall have to have...

141
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
From which direction will their
attack come, and who will command?

142
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,520
Montgomery or Patton?

143
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,280
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.

144
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,520
He is their best.

145
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,040
Patton will lead the assault.

146
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,240
I would prefer Montgomery...

147
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,760
but even Eisenhower
isn't that stupid.

148
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,000
Bittrich's panzer troops
need some rest...

149
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,800
if they're to stop Patton.

150
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,200
We should pull them back
somewhere safe.

151
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Safe, quiet, out of the way.
But where?

152
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,920
Arnhem?

153
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,840
Arnhem.

154
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,840
- I'll be in touch.
- That'll be fine.

155
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,480
Why the emergency meeting?

156
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,520
- Keeping abreast of the little changes.
- How big are the little changes?

157
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll answer you with typical
British understatement: gigantic.

158
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,000
They can't get us
all in at once.

159
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,640
Too many men, too much equipment,
not enough planes.

160
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,360
It's going to take three days to get the
men into Arnhem, Poles and the British.

161
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,520
- How about us?
- We'll be all right.

162
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,520
Aside from the fact that we'll parachute
in daylight, we have no worries.

163
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,400
Daylight?

164
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
- Has it ever been tried before?
- Not in a major drop.

165
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,720
-Think there might be a reason for that?
-Let's hope not.

166
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,720
- What do you think?
- It'll be all right.

167
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
It's a "no moon" period anyway.
We have to go in daylight.

168
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,640
Just so they get us over
the target area, half a mile away.

169
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,760
Three-quarters of a mile...
I'll settle for that.

170
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,440
I don't want to hear anything else.

171
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,200
- Is there anything else?
- Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry.

172
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
I forgot to tell you something?

173
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,120
Only that the Germans first tried
to take Nijmegen Bridge themselves...

174
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,480
back in 1940,
and got slaughtered.

175
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,480
Go back!

176
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,720
Go back!

177
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
Do as I say!

178
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
But my friend lives
down the road.

179
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,880
It's my birthday
and she has a present for me.

180
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,520
Please let me through.

181
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
All right. Be quick.

182
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,920
Are you sure about the colors?

183
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm sure, Father.
Believe me.

184
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,880
Model?

185
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,160
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?

186
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,560
The British will have
an explanation.

187
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,560
Did you pass on
the message about the tanks?

188
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,560
Of course. But Model is
something more important.

189
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,280
You're a good boy
and a wonderful spy.

190
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,800
Now go and help
your mother with supper.

191
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,600
- Sir?
- Yes, Fuller?

192
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,840
- We've got some information on tanks.
- What?

193
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,240
Dutch Underground reports
from the Arnhem area.

194
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,800
- Established their strength?
- No, sir, but I've got...

195
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,600
- Have they been identified?
- Not by our intelligence, sir.

196
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,120
So it's the same rumors
as before, right?

197
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,920
- I believe these rumors, sir.
- Why?

198
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,360
The general consensus of opinion
is that our opposition...

199
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,160
will consist entirely of Hitler Youth
or old men on bicycles.

200
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,160
I don't really know why, sir.

201
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,680
Perhaps because no one
in Intelligence does.

202
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,600
I just want to be sure
our airborne carpet...

203
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,800
consists of live troops,
not dead ones.

204
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,280
I know everybody thinks
I'm overanxious, sir...

205
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,640
but I would like to order another
low-level reconnaissance of the area.

206
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,240
If that's all right
with you, sir.

207
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,960
Very well.

208
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,720
All right, Wilson.

209
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
Very well.

210
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,160
I wouldn't be too concerned
about what people think of you.

211
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,840
You happen to be somewhat
brighter than most of us.

212
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,000
Tends to make us nervous.

213
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,360
Naturally we'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements, sir.

214
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,400
But please keep in mind...

215
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,720
the one factor which is
crippling all our plans.

216
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,000
It may seem improbable to you...

217
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,000
but we are desperately short
of transport aircraft.

218
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,320
I am aware of that.

219
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,960
I was surprised that nobody mentioned it
to Monty when he dreamed up this plan.

220
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,080
I need drop zones as close
as possible to the bridge.

221
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,200
This area's no use at all.

222
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,880
Can't have my chaps landing on chimney
tops, but this looks inviting here.

223
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,720
- What's the terrain like?
- Sorry, sir.

224
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,560
Our reports indicate that this terrain
is too soft for glider landings.

225
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,600
The nose digs in first on touchdown,
the thing goes ass over tip.

226
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,800
Total write-off.

227
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,520
All right.

228
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,720
- What about there?
- Afraid not, sir.

229
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,720
You see, after the drop,
when we bank for our return...

230
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,720
we run into
a whole lot of flak...

231
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,680
from this Jerry airfield
up here at Deelen.

232
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,560
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere?

233
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,240
Oh, yes.
Hopefully, sir.

234
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,000
But as I was saying, we cannot afford
to lose a single aircraft.

235
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,000
That is the problem.

236
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,760
My problem is,
I don't just need drop zones.

237
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,000
I need drop zones
I can hold and defend.

238
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,600
The rest of my division arrives
with the second drop...

239
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,480
and General Sosabowski's
Polish Brigade with the third.

240
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,160
I understand, sir, but we really
think we've found the right place.

241
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,720
It's large enough for your needs,
it's flat and firm.

242
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,720
- It's also easily defended.
- Where the hell is it?

243
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,080
Well, it's not actually
on this photograph.

244
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,440
It should be...
Excuse me, sir...

245
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,560
It would be about here,
I think.

246
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,440
That could be
ten miles from the bridge.

247
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,760
It's just under eight actually, sir,
if you'd like to have a look at this.

248
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,080
You see, the terrain
is easy to traverse.

249
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,800
All our information
substantiates that.

250
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,360
Yes, sir?

251
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,200
Just making sure
whose side you're on.

252
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,800
Now, a drop zone
eight miles from Arnhem Bridge...

253
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,240
might be thought by some
to present problems.

254
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
My God, he can't mean it.

255
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,920
I'm afraid he does.
Must know what he's doing.

256
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,560
That's more than I know. Why should
he have a corner on the market?

257
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,640
...cannot under any stretch
of the imagination be considered ideal.

258
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,720
But the gliders will be bringing in
a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps...

259
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,960
specially fitted
with twin Vickers machine guns.

260
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,480
The instant we land,
they will race ahead to the bridge...

261
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,160
and hold it...

262
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
until the other battalions
arrive on foot.

263
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,360
And they'll be quick enough
to secure both ends of Arnhem Bridge?

264
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,560
- Most certainly.
- Good.

265
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,680
My headquarters will be
in the center with 82nd.

266
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,360
Now, just you remember that
we're all totally interlocked.

267
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,440
This is a bottom-to-top operation.

268
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,880
101st pass 30 Corps
on to 82nd.

269
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,320
82nd pass them on
to British Airborne.

270
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,120
If any one group fails,
it's total failure for us all.

271
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,520
All we need now
are three days of clear skies.

272
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,640
Thank you, gentlemen,
very much.

273
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,600
Only the weather
can stop us now.

274
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,080
Weather! Cristos!

275
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,360
What of the Germans?
Don't you think that since we know...

276
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,240
that Arnhem is so crucial to their
safety, they might know that too?

277
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,800
Now look here.

278
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,520
The few troops
in the area are...

279
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,000
second class.

280
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,160
They're not front-line caliber.

281
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,480
Not at all.
Do you understand?

282
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
You ought to have more faith
in Montgomery's intelligence reports.

283
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,240
He's done pretty well for us
in the last three or four years.

284
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,080
I will tell you
the extent of my faith.

285
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,240
I'm thinking of asking
for a letter from you...

286
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,200
stating that I was forced
to act on your orders...

287
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,000
in case my men are massacred.

288
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,720
I see.

289
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes, I do see.

290
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,080
Do you wish such a letter?

291
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
Of course not.

292
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,280
In the case of massacre,
what difference would it make?

293
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,240
- You don't believe me, sir?
- Clearly not.

294
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,920
All right, boys, Naafi's up.
Take your break.

295
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,240
God Almighty!

296
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,120
Sorry about that, sir.
But what then?

297
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,440
I just don't believe these
damn radios are strong enough...

298
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,480
to carry the eight miles
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

299
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,320
Don't happen to have
any cigarettes, do you, sir?

300
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,880
They're perfectly okay.
I've used them God knows how many times.

301
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,680
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.

302
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,040
Well, I didn't have any problems
with them in the desert.

303
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,840
Yes, I know,
but you see, Cole...

304
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,880
what genuinely and truly has me more
than a bit disturbed is that Holland...

305
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,320
being half underwater, is soggier
than most deserts you're apt to find.

306
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,040
Tends to have
a lot more trees.

307
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,040
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

308
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,960
Shouldn't you tell the general
if you're so certain about it, sir?

309
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,720
If I were,
believe me, I would.

310
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,080
- What if they really don't work?
- What difference will it make?

311
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,760
The general will be on
the bridge himself by nightfall.

312
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,360
He won't have to make contact with
the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?

313
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,840
Well, if anyone
rocks the boat...

314
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,840
it's not gonna be me.

315
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,880
The regular projector chap's at lunch,
sir. I'll have it in a moment.

316
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,520
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.
Don't worry. I don't need lunch.

317
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,680
Damn. Nearly there, sir.

318
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,800
It's really worth your time, sir.
Believe me.

319
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,760
There.

320
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,800
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
Can't see any tanks.

321
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,720
Wait a moment, sir.
It's a lot clearer in the next picture.

322
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,640
If I can just...

323
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,800
Now.

324
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,440
- Next.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,760
I've had this one enlarged.

326
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,280
I shouldn't worry about them.

327
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,920
But, sir, you see
that they are tanks.

328
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,520
I doubt if they're
fully serviceable.

329
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,640
- Still got guns.
- So have we.

330
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,360
But, sir...

331
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:05,040
if they weren't serviceable,
why would they try to conceal them?

332
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,880
Normal routine, Fuller.

333
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,360
But, sir, we keep getting reports
from the Dutch Underground.

334
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,720
I've read them!
And so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

335
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,040
Now look here.

336
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,160
There have been thousands of photographs
from this sortie and from the others.

337
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,160
- How many of them have shown tanks?
- Just these, sir.

338
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,680
And you seriously consider
asking us to cancel...

339
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,840
the biggest operation
mounted since D-Day...

340
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,640
because of three photographs?

341
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,560
No, sir.

342
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,880
Sixteen consecutive drops have been
cancelled in the last few months...

343
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,360
for one reason or another.

344
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,080
But this time
the party's on...

345
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,360
and no one is going
to call it off.

346
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,160
Is that fully understood?

347
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,720
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,400
Thank you, Waddy.

349
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
Thank you, gentlemen.

350
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,360
Do sit down, gentlemen.
Please sit down.

351
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,720
Look after these.

352
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,800
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

353
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,480
Gentlemen, this is a story
that you will tell your grandchildren...

354
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,480
and mightily bored they'll be.

355
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,280
The plan is called
Operation Market Garden.

356
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,560
Market is the airborne element,
and Garden the ground forces...

357
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,080
That's us.

358
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,840
Now this is our position
on the Belgian border here.

359
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,400
Tomorrow, three airborne divisions
will begin landing in Holland...

360
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,760
thirty-five thousand men
taking off from 24 airfields...

361
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,680
in troop-carrying planes
or towed in gliders.

362
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,280
The American 101st here...

363
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,440
around Eindhoven...

364
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,000
the American 82nd here...

365
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,160
south of Nijmegen...

366
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,840
and our own 1st Airborne boys
and a Polish brigade...

367
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,240
here at Arnhem...

368
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,320
sixty-four miles...

369
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,320
behind enemy lines.

370
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,400
Now, their job
is to take and hold...

371
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,560
all the bridges
in these three areas.

372
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,320
Our job is to punch a hole...

373
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,120
through the German
front line here...

374
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,720
and then drive like hell
up this road...

375
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,360
linking up with each
airborne division on the way up.

376
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,400
Speed is the vital factor.

377
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,320
The plan is to reach Eindhoven
in two to three hours...

378
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,280
and Arnhem in two to three days.

379
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,880
That, gentlemen,
is the prize:

380
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,040
the bridge over the Rhine...

381
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,320
the last bridge
between us and Germany.

382
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,480
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours
tomorrow afternoon.

383
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,080
The Irish Guards, under the command of
Colonel Vandeleur, will take the lead.

384
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,000
- Christ, not us again.
- What do you say to that, Joe?

385
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,320
Delighted, sir.
Truly delighted.

386
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,880
I've selected you to lead us...

387
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,160
not only because of your
extraordinary fighting ability...

388
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,160
but also because...

389
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,000
in the unlikely event
that the Germans ever get you...

390
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,680
they will assume from your attire that
they've captured a wretched peasant...

391
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,200
and immediately
send you on your way.

392
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,720
Now, maintaining
the speed of our advance...

393
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,960
will no doubt be tough going,
as it's a single highway.

394
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,640
But no matter what...

395
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,440
we must reach those
1st Airborne boys in 48 hours.

396
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,280
Now, gentlemen...

397
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,160
I'm not saying that this
will be the easiest party...

398
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,360
that we've ever attended...

399
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,080
but I still wouldn't
miss it for the world.

400
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,400
I like to think of this...

401
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,880
as one of those
American Western films.

402
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,560
The paratroops,
lacking substantial equipment...

403
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,560
always short of food...

404
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,440
These are the
besieged homesteaders.

405
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,880
The Germans...
well, naturally they're the bad guys.

406
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,800
And 30 Corps...

407
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,200
We, my friends,
are the cavalry...

408
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,920
on the way to the rescue.

409
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,240
Do you want me
to pack that as well, sir?

410
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,240
No, thank you, Wicks.
I'll carry it.

411
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,680
You haven't forgotten
my golf clubs, have you?

412
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,760
They'll be coming later
in the staff car, sir.

413
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,680
And what about...

414
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,640
Sorry, sir?

415
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,000
What about my dinner jacket?

416
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,040
Are you sure you'll be
needing that, sir?

417
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,080
Well, let's hope so.

418
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Why don't you quit that?

419
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
Chock-full of vitamins.

420
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,960
Here, Eddie.
Have a little strength.

421
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,400
Hey, where'd you put that?

422
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,480
- Damn it, Eddie, give it back.
- Right.

423
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,360
There you are.

424
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,680
I wish you hadn't done that.

425
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,160
My problem is, I'm not totally crazy
about the prospect of dyin'.

426
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,160
So don't die.

427
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Drinkin' that garbage
isn't gonna keep you alive.

428
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,320
What is?

429
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,320
- Not gettin' shot.
- And what can guarantee that?

430
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,880
Nothin', for sure.

431
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,720
- You will.
- I will what?

432
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,480
You tell me, Eddie.
You tell me I won't die.

433
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
All right, you won't die.

434
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,400
No, no. Guarantee me.

435
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,360
I want you to guarantee me
I won't die.

436
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,000
I guarantee you.

437
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,360
Come on.
Let's get some food in you.

438
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,800
I wasn't kidding.

439
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,080
Hey, Eddie,
were you kidding?

440
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,120
Major Fuller.

441
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,200
My name is Sims.
Mind a bit of company?

442
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,400
Of course not, sir.

443
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,600
Busy times.

444
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,800
You must be exhausted.

445
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,440
Are you exhausted?

446
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,000
Who isn't?

447
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,360
We've been getting reports
from a number of your friends.

448
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,440
They're worried about you.
They think perhaps you need a rest.

449
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,000
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?

450
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
Is it because
I rocked the boat?

451
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,600
I'm a doctor.
I'm only concerned with your health.

452
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,920
I think perhaps you ought
to take a bit of sick leave.

453
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,720
But why?

454
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,360
I'm not ill or anything.

455
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,360
I haven't done anything wrong.

456
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,520
Of course not.
You're just a little tired.

457
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,240
I am tired.

458
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,640
I think perhaps we might go.

459
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
Can't it be stopped?

460
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,880
I don't want
to be left behind, please.

461
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,240
It's out of my hands, laddie.

462
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,640
I didn't want to miss the party.

463
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,080
Move it, buddy.
That's the way.

464
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,880
Home, sweet home.

465
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,880
When you think we only had seven days to
get everything organized, it's quite a...

466
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
Bloody miracle.

467
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,200
It took six months
to set up the D-Day drop...

468
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,800
and that was only
half as big as this.

469
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

470
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,720
I'll feel even better
when we're in Holland.

471
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,640
Do you remember when I was
appointed to this command...

472
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,640
I told you I had never jumped,
but thought I ought to give it a go?

473
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,800
- Well, you did me a big favor.
- Really? What?

474
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,720
You said, "Roy, you're far too old for
that kind of thing, and much too large."

475
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,080
Did I?
What was the favor?

476
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,760
Well, I didn't quite tell you
everything at the time...

477
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,160
but I'm prone to airsickness.

478
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,160
Good gracious.
What, every flight?

479
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,720
Well, we'll soon find out,
won't we?

480
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,240
Go on! Get that
goddamn jeep outta here!

481
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,440
Who would true valor see

482
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,000
Let him come hither

483
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,080
One here will constant be

484
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,360
Come wind
Come weather

485
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,880
There's no discouragement

486
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,760
Soon be home, Harry.

487
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,920
- Better than the desert, eh, sir?
- What was that?

488
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,920
Easier than walking, sir.

489
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,880
If you say so, Hancock.

490
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
Yeah, fine, sir.

491
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,880
The artillery should be able to clear
the way very well. Your initial advance.

492
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,000
Yes, we'll move off as soon
as their barrage has got going.

493
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,800
- Yes, that's absolutely fine.
- Follow behind it as close as we can.

494
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,000
But you know...

495
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,280
this isn't gonna be the pushover
that everybody seems to think it is.

496
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,000
No, I didn't think so.

497
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,360
Morning, Alan. Your sleeping beauties
know there's a war on, do they?

498
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,680
Absolutely, sir.

499
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,920
Is it true that the Germans have put
more troops into the line ahead of us?

500
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,480
Yes. They obviously don't intend
to just let us walk in the front door.

501
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,040
Hello, Bob! Hope that's not
my funeral they're going to.

502
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,200
And I'm still
desperately worried...

503
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,440
about having them throw
everything up this road.

504
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,560
But there's no alternative.
Morning, Tom.

505
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,480
So I've decided to run
the road like a railway.

506
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,920
Nobody, repeat,
nobody will be allowed...

507
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,000
to put any vehicle on that road
without my permission.

508
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,000
- Including me?
- Good luck to you!

509
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,920
You too!
Especially you, Joe.

510
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,640
Morning, Derek!

511
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,200
Glad to see somebody
knows where we're going.

512
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,120
Time, Joe.
That's the killer.

513
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,800
We can't afford
to drop behind schedule.

514
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,960
So for God's sake,
keep your tanks on the move.

515
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,040
Good God Almighty.

516
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,760
That's just the 101st.

517
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,800
The other two groups
are on the northern route.

518
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,280
H hour in 90 minutes.

519
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,880
- I'd better be going, sir.
- Right you are, Joe.

520
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,400
- Any last-minute changes, Bob?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,840
If the advance runs into difficulty, we
call in the Air Force with purple smoke.

522
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,760
First class.
And good luck, Joe!

523
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,480
Thank you, sir.

524
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,160
Think you'll be able
to manage it?

525
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,680
I've got nothing else planned
for this afternoon.

526
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,600
I told you you should have had
the bloody thing out.

527
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,840
What the hell's that?

528
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,840
It's flak.

529
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,080
General Bittrich!

530
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
In here, Matthias.

531
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,080
Fantastic, isn't it?

532
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,040
Just once to have
such power in my hands.

533
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,000
Red on.

534
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,560
Come on, move yourselves!

535
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,080
If there's no more opposition than this
on the road, we should be all right.

536
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,320
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

537
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,080
B Company, to me!

538
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,920
A Company, over there!

539
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,360
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshal, but...

540
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,960
British paratroopers
have landed...

541
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,800
three kilometers from here.

542
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,400
Why should they do that?

543
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,920
There is nothing
important here.

544
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,160
Me! I am important.

545
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,320
They must all be coming
just to capture me.

546
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,120
Call my chauffeur and car.

547
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,760
Evacuate the headquarters.

548
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,520
And don't forget my cigars.

549
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:11,360
General!

550
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,160
- You all right?
- Yeah.

551
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,720
Okay, you guys,
gather your stuff and move!

552
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,240
- This is it, Jim.
- Okay, sir.

553
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,520
You okay?

554
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,560
Right! Let's go!

555
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,880
Then keep trying.

556
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,200
There must be someone there!

557
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,840
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.

558
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,520
They say thousands of troops
are dropping over Holland.

559
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,040
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.

560
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,280
I can't get through
to his headquarters.

561
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,480
A strong force has landed
south of Nijmegen.

562
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,800
Nijmegen?
They're after the bridge.

563
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,240
That doesn't matter.

564
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,440
Perhaps they've landed
in the Field Marshal's soup.

565
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,720
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now listen.

566
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,960
I'll take care of Arnhem.

567
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,480
You get to Nijmegen
as fast as you can.

568
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,920
Take anything that'll move...

569
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,800
every man that can walk,
and hold the bridge.

570
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,680
No. Field Marshal Model.

571
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,920
Nothing must cross it.
Is that clear?

572
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,040
You must hold that bridge
under any circumstances.

573
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,960
- Understood?
- Clear.

574
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Ryan and Ross,
come with me.

575
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,960
Cover the right flank.

576
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,160
How far away is headquarters?

577
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,320
Half a mile.
Maybe more.

578
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,760
Brigadier Lathbury's
just left, sir.

579
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,280
Johnny Frost and the 2nd Battalion
are on the river road.

580
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,760
Good.

581
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,880
Thank you, Baker. Any news of
Freddie Gough's jeep squadron?

582
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,160
- It's unconfirmed...
- It's rather bad luck, sir.

583
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,000
Considering how few gliders
we lost on the way in.

584
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,240
It appears that a lot of
the special jeeps failed to arrive...

585
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,880
and those that did have been
badly shot up in an ambush.

586
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,400
So no one's going to get
to Arnhem Bridge except on foot.

587
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,400
Splendid.

588
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,080
They must be from the lunatic asylum,
located on the far side of the wood.

589
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,960
They escaped when
it was bombed this morning.

590
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,120
Do you think they know
something we don't?

591
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,080
All guns, commence firing!

592
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,080
Right, get moving.
Get moving.

593
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,640
Driver, advance.

594
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,280
Start the purple!

595
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,760
Start the purple!

596
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,960
Take cover!

597
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,520
- Loading!
- Fire!

598
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,600
Get the wounded down the line.

599
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,800
Get that wreck off the road.

600
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,520
Joe, how the hell...

601
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,120
How the hell do they expect us
to keep to schedule on a road like this?

602
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,480
You don't know the worst.

603
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,200
- This bit we're on now...
- Yes?

604
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,320
It's the wide part.

605
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,200
Peter, the general's coming in.

606
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,680
- How's it going now?
- Not too well, sir.

607
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,280
We haven't been able to make contact
with General Browning...

608
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,280
30 Corps or England.

609
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,720
So no one knows
we've arrived safely.

610
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,960
Not as far as we know, sir.

611
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,560
What about those VHF sets?

612
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,360
Well, sir, it appears the sets have
been delivered with the wrong crystals.

613
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,920
- So they're quite useless?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid they are.

614
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,920
Are Brigadier Lathbury and Colonel Frost
aware of what happened...

615
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,520
- to the special jeep squadron?
- Not as far as we know.

616
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,160
At the moment we're unable to contact
any of the units moving into Arnhem.

617
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,880
Not a very satisfactory
state of affairs.

618
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,960
We can't quite understand it.
It's perfectly good equipment.

619
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,240
Then for God's sake,
get it sorted out...

620
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,240
before we have a bloody disaster
on our hands.

621
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,920
Sir.

622
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,760
Hancock...

623
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,520
I've got lunatics
laughing at me from the woods.

624
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,640
My original plan has been scuppered
now that the jeeps haven't arrived.

625
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,440
My communications
have completely broken down.

626
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,520
Do you really believe
that any of that can be helped...

627
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,520
by a cup of tea?

628
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,120
Couldn't hurt, sir.

629
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,560
Forgive me for returning,
Field Marshal.

630
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,400
I must press for permission...

631
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,960
if it becomes necessary...

632
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,240
to blow up the bridges
at Arnhem and Nijmegen.

633
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,080
That is out of the question.

634
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,560
Never.
Is that clear?

635
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,560
We need them
for our counterattack.

636
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,360
Counterattack?
With what?

637
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,400
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.

638
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,600
Isolated they are lost.

639
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,320
I have spoken
to Von Rundstedt.

640
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,920
All reinforcements
come to us first.

641
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,200
Every hour we get stronger
and they grow weaker.

642
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,800
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.

643
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,040
Do you really think
if they wanted the bridges...

644
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,120
they would have landed
12 kilometers away?

645
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,120
It's ridiculous.

646
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,440
Thank you for the tea.

647
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,760
Our lightning-like assault
on Arnhem Bridge...

648
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,280
is certainly a smashing success.

649
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,480
I've an aversion to apples.
I'm so sorry.

650
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,200
I'm sure the Germans will
be thunderstruck with surprise.

651
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,200
- Are there many of you?
- Yes, there are thousands of us.

652
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,840
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

653
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,360
Look here, this isn't
a victory parade.

654
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,840
Come on, sir,
enjoy the moment.

655
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,880
I will enjoy the moment
when we reach the bridge...

656
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,880
and when we find the bridge intact.

657
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,360
It will be.
Things couldn't be going better.

658
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:34,240
- Nothing's wrong.
- I know. That's exactly what is wrong.

659
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,800
Jesus Christ!

660
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,760
Stay down!

661
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,000
Shit.

662
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,280
There's still no contact.

663
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,560
Then keep at it.
I shall be back shortly.

664
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,240
Brigadier Lathbury can't have gone
that far. All right, Brown.

665
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,360
I'm sure we'll have them fixed
by the time you get back, sir.

666
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,200
Can you get a message down
to 30th Corps on that dingus?

667
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:38,520
Yes, sir. We just got word
from the 82nd up ahead.

668
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,000
They've captured the Grave Bridge
completely intact.

669
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,040
That's terrific,
except 30th Corps...

670
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,880
ain't about to reach
the goddamn intact Grave Bridge...

671
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,000
until the goddamn Son Bridge
gets fixed.

672
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,240
Tell our British cousins
to hustle up some Bailey stuff.

673
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,040
I'll meet 'em in Eindhoven
when they get there.

674
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,880
Tell those schmucks to do this right and
have their Bailey stuff at the front.

675
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,080
Got that?

676
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,400
And be sure to say please.

677
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,800
Joe, I make it just over six miles
to Eindhoven.

678
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,640
We won't make it tonight.
It'll be dark shortly.

679
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:23,720
Well, I hope to God the 101st
can hang on till tomorrow.

680
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,320
Giles, remember what the general said:
"We're the cavalry."

681
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:33,080
It would be bad form
to arrive in advance of schedule.

682
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,440
In the nick of time
would do nicely.

683
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,880
These plans should have
been left in England.

684
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,240
They're top secret.

685
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,920
And now we have all we need...

686
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
units, defense plans,
objectives...

687
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,600
and the schedule
for further drops.

688
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,200
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge
for demolition...

689
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,800
if I blow it up tonight.

690
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,080
This Operation Market Garden
must fail.

691
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:07,360
Why do all my generals
want to destroy my bridges?

692
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,160
Come, Ludwig.
We'll have dinner.

693
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,240
Dinner?

694
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,240
But what about these plans?

695
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,840
These plans?
They are false.

696
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,400
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.

697
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,400
White wine or red?

698
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,200
We're still getting nothing from Colonel
Frost's battalion on the river road.

699
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,440
- Thank you, Cole.
- Dog-Charlie-Fox. Over.

700
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,840
Let's hope Johnny's meeting
less resistance than we are.

701
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,040
- We must break through to the bridge.
- We're completely blocked ahead of us.

702
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,560
There's a good deal more resistance
than we've been led to expect.

703
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,800
I must see for myself how he's doing.
All right, Cole.

704
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,000
- What is their strength?
- I can't estimate yet.

705
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,280
Some Dutch Underground people were here
earlier trying to explain the situation.

706
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:55,200
I'm not sure how much they know.

707
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:13,040
Stretcher bearer, bring that stretcher
over here to these men!

708
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,120
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it.

709
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,800
Christ Almighty!
They've gone round behind us.

710
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:22,520
I think it might be safer
if you spent the night with us.

711
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,240
- I've got to get back to H. Q.
- Yes, but alive, sir.

712
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,520
If we can reach them,
there are some houses in that direction.

713
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,200
We can get ourselves organized
and try and find out what's happening.

714
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,240
Pull him out!

715
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,240
- Right.
- Sergeant Major.

716
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,200
Come on, lads.
Get a move on.

717
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,240
- Something just occurred to me.
- What's that, sir?

718
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,080
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.

719
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:44,840
It's all very well for the country,
but we won't fool anyone in the towns.

720
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,440
Come on.

721
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,200
I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid we're
going to have to occupy your house.

722
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,320
- All right, chaps, we're in here.
- The house on the other side.

723
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,600
- Section Two, over here.
- Dick.

724
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,760
Now, take your men,
occupy that house across the road.

725
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,960
Make sure you can cover the bridge
from your side.

726
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,160
Sergeant, follow me.

727
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,280
Hello, Dog-Charlie-Fox.

728
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,040
Rip down those curtains,
pile this furniture against the window.

729
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,880
We've reached our objective.
What is your position? Over.

730
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:31,800
There's nothing.

731
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,880
I can't contact Brigade
at all, sir.

732
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,960
Tried the other battalions?

733
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,680
Any luck?

734
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,800
Keep trying.

735
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,120
- Order them out.
- Please, Mother.

736
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,640
- This is my house.
- Perhaps by tomorrow.

737
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,520
Tomorrow?

738
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,520
Yes, Mother.

739
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:14,880
Shall we have a go
at the far end now, sir?

740
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,200
"Having a go" is hardly
textbook terminology, Harry.

741
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,000
But you'll let us try, sir?

742
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,200
Down! Take cover!

743
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,080
Cover fire! Quick!

744
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:30,480
Smoke!

745
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,560
Come on, lads!

746
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,960
Come on. Keep going.

747
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,760
Give us a hand.

748
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,200
Roll back!

749
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,240
Hurry.

750
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,280
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

751
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,760
We'll deal with them later...

752
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,760
when it gets dark.

753
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,840
- Made it so far, Doddsie?
- Aye.

754
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,880
Better hit that slit first time.

755
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,040
Hey, Corp, I said you'd better
hit that slit first time or...

756
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,680
I heard you, boyo.

757
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,720
Oh, great.

758
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,720
After you, Corp.

759
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,080
Come on.
Let's get on with it.

760
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,440
Now!

761
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,520
Now we're in trouble.
You bloody missed it!

762
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,880
You knocked my arm,
you clumsy bastard.

763
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,360
Now we'll never get out of here.

764
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,560
We've hit an ammunition dump,
a bloody ammo dump. Shit!

765
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,720
Fool's courage.

766
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,280
She says you are much too noisy.

767
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,360
She does realize there is something
of a war going on, doesn't she?

768
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,920
She has never liked noise.
She hates it.

769
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,320
They're coming.

770
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,840
Excuse me.

771
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,080
Many of them?

772
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,760
Can't tell, sir.
We can only hear them at the moment.

773
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,160
Hold your fire!

774
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,680
Hold your fire!

775
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Fire!

776
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,800
Command. Wait for the command.

777
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,440
Over there with it.
Look after that man.

778
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,880
Open fire! Fire!

779
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,640
Keep firing. Come on.

780
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,640
Cease firing.

781
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:34,280
Sorry, ma'am.

782
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,760
Try and rustle up
some more bandages, will you?

783
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,360
Lad, you'll be all right.
See you later.

784
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,000
Get him patched up, Doc.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

785
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,480
- Wicks.
- Sir.

786
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,440
Right, off you go.

787
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,640
Get that bloody stretcher inside!

788
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,800
All right. Here we go.

789
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,440
Good morning. Mr. Cornish
is straight through there.

790
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,440
Right. Thank you.

791
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,240
Hello, Dick.
It's all right. Sit down.

792
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:32,640
- You all right?
- Fine. It's only a flesh wound.

793
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,200
- How are things?
- Not too bad, sir.

794
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:39,000
What is bad is this.

795
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,440
- Careful.
- Sorry.

796
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:44,040
We hold the north end of the bridge.
The Germans hold the south.

797
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,600
But now they probably control
most of the town...

798
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,680
including the church tower.

799
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,680
What you're saying is
that we're surrounded.

800
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,240
Yes, something like that.

801
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,040
- What else?
- Sir.

802
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,360
I was a bit surprised to find
Bittrich's panzer troops here, sir.

803
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:11,280
Yes, well, surely you didn't believe
all that nonsense they told us.

804
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:15,520
I mean, about the enemy being
made up of old men, children.

805
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,760
We'll have to risk it.

806
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,080
It's halfway through the morning,
and things aren't getting any better.

807
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,560
- Sergeant, how is it?
- Sir.

808
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,200
We can't clear the streets.

809
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,640
Enemy strength keeps increasing. It's
impossible to get through to the bridge.

810
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,440
Thanks, Sergeant.

811
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,280
It's imperative I get back to H. Q.
before the situation gets out of hand.

812
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,120
If it's all right with you, Cleminson
and I will come part of the way.

813
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,400
- All right, Jimmy?
- Let's move.

814
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,560
End house,
bottom window, sir.

815
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,160
Cleminson, get over here.

816
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,640
Hang on, Gerald.

817
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,760
In here. Come on.

818
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,760
Can't you move your legs?

819
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,960
Must be the spine.
Can you help us?

820
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,640
- How?
- Don't you know a doctor nearby?

821
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,720
We can take him to the hospital.

822
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,480
You go. He will be fine.

823
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,040
Go, sir.

824
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,200
You go.

825
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,640
Go up.

826
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:14,200
They're certainly at the back.
What's it like at the front?

827
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,040
We're surrounded.

828
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,360
Yes. Quite.

829
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,960
I was rather expecting to see you
again, General Sosabowski.

830
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,960
Do please sit down.

831
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,200
The Polish drop has been cancelled
again. I would like an explanation.

832
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,600
Well, I expect the fog has
a certain amount to do with it.

833
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:50,360
I'm told there are aircraft flying
50 miles to the south.

834
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:53,240
Explain to me why my men and equipment
cannot be moved from here to there...

835
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,640
and then fly to Arnhem.

836
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,800
That's a very reasonable question.

837
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:01,840
I don't want to bother you with
a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo...

838
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,480
but the fact is, you see,
whether we like it or not...

839
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,120
fog... it moves.

840
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,600
Of course it moves. Where?

841
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,800
That's very difficult
to say, General.

842
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,560
It's very slippery stuff, fog.

843
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,680
You think you've got it,
then it reverses itself...

844
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,280
and leaves you behind.

845
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:23,600
Won't you please sit down?

846
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:25,920
What I'm trying to say, General...

847
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,240
is even if we move your troops
the 50 miles...

848
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,680
I grant you,
now the sun is shining...

849
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,880
the chances are that
by the time we get there...

850
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:35,920
the fog could quite easily
have preceded us.

851
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:39,520
- So we simply have to wait.
- And do nothing.

852
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,760
I think that puts it rather well.

853
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,200
Hey, you! You Vandeleur?

854
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,240
- Yeah.
- I'm Bobby Stout.

855
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,680
How do you do?

856
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,360
Hell of a day, huh?
Look at 'em... wild.

857
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,040
Have you ever been liberated?

858
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,040
- I got divorced twice. Does that count?
- Yes, that counts.

859
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,680
Hey, that Bailey crap.
You got it amongst this stuff?

860
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,040
When you refer to Bailey crap...

861
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:50,120
I take it you mean that glorious
precision-made British-built bridge...

862
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,240
which is the envy
of the civilized world.

863
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,360
- Yeah.
- The trucks are down there somewhere.

864
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,000
But how you're going to get them
through this crowd, I don't know.

865
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,440
No problem. I got a side road
pegged out that'll avoid all this.

866
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:04,000
- American ingenuity.
- Oh, really?

867
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,120
Actually I was born in Yugoslavia,
but what the hell.

868
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,640
Yes.

869
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,560
Okay, I'll take it, sir.

870
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,960
- Where the hell have you been?
- With some Dutch friends at Nijmegen.

871
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,800
Look. This is why
we can't take the bridge.

872
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,840
The Germans have moved in
S. S. panzer troops.

873
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,880
You'd think they didn't want us
to get across or something.

874
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,800
They've sealed off the whole area.

875
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,920
Here. You can see on this map.

876
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,400
Every street leading to the bridge
is blocked.

877
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:49,480
Every house around it is occupied.

878
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:53,000
The Dutch Underground people say
it's just impossible to break through.

879
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,160
They could be right.

880
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:03,320
- Where's the captain?
- Dead.

881
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,280
I didn't ask you how he was.
I asked you where he was.

882
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,880
Orderly, we're all out
of bandages over here.

883
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,240
- Sir.
- Not now.

884
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,440
- I'd like you to look at my captain.
- I'm sorry. Put him down.

885
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,680
What in the name of hell
do you...

886
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,800
- You told me to put him down.
- I'm in no mood for crapping around.

887
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,480
If you don't look at him right now,
he's going to die.

888
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,480
He's dead now.

889
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,720
It'd mean a lot to me
if you'd check him out.

890
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,040
Come on, Sergeant.
For Christ's sake, get him out of here.

891
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,840
Would you look at him,
please, sir...

892
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,240
right now...

893
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,400
or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off.

894
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,720
Right now.

895
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,640
I can give him a quick examination,
if you like.

896
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,840
Thank you very much, sir.

897
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,920
Son of a bitch.

898
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,600
Orderly!

899
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,480
Well, I got the bullet
out of his skull.

900
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,760
-He's gonna live though, right?
-He's gonna have one hell of a headache.

901
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,800
Guess you can turn me in now, sir.

902
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,640
That was a court-martial offense.
You understand that?

903
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,720
- Yes, sir.
- Hope to hell it was worth it.

904
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:12,120
Guess only time
will tell on that, sir.

905
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:15,000
My response is strictly limited,
regardless of my personal preference.

906
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,960
- You understand that too?
- I do.

907
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,280
Like somebody cheating in school.

908
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:21,640
Once word gets out that you can behave
any way you goddamn please...

909
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:24,160
discipline's gone,
forget about getting it back.

910
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:27,440
So you're gonna have to be arrested,
over and out. Lieutenant Rafferty.

911
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,280
Yes, sir, Colonel.

912
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,560
Lieutenant Rafferty,
this is Sergeant... What's your name?

913
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:34,400
Eddie Dohun.

914
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,720
Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me
and threatened to kill me...

915
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,240
unless I did precisely
what he ordered.

916
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,240
- I want you to put him under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

917
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:45,080
I want you to keep him there
for at least ten seconds.

918
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:50,240
- I'm not all that sure I understand.
- Count to ten, Lieutenant, fast.

919
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,280
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten. Like that?

920
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,880
Thank you, Lieutenant.

921
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,880
This is yours, I think.

922
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,920
It sure looks like mine.

923
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,720
You scared the shit out of me,
you stupid bastard.

924
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,200
You did a fine job yourself,
if it makes you feel any better.

925
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,400
Goddamn right it does.

926
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:20,080
- Eddie?
- Sir.

927
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,200
You wouldn't really
have killed me, would you?

928
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,760
Thank you, sir.

929
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:50,480
Right!
Let's haul a little ass! Go!

930
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:06,680
Hold! Hold!

931
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,960
Move it. Come on, soldier,
you're not building a sand castle.

932
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:44,160
Come on, boys.
Use your muscle.

933
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,240
Heave.

934
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,240
Come on, heave!

935
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,240
Unload quickly.

936
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,560
- It's all right, sir.
- Come on, move yourself.

937
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,640
We haven't got all day.

938
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:07,360
Come on, push!

939
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:28,760
Altogether, lift!

940
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:35,840
Come on, soldier, pound it.
We've got a schedule to meet.

941
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,560
Steady.

942
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,240
Hold it.

943
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,360
- How much longer now?
- About another four hours, sir.

944
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:15,640
Shit.

945
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:20,040
Come on, boys.
We're not doing this for fun.

946
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:53,080
- Hey, soldier, get over here.
- Yes, sir.

947
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,400
- Pull on this rope.
- Yes, sir.

948
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,720
Didn't you ever build
a Bailey bridge before?

949
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,360
Neither did I.

950
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:16,200
Clear the way! Clear!

951
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:22,640
We haven't got all day.

952
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:25,080
Roll it, fellas!

953
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,000
Right. Come on. All aboard.
Let's get moving again.

954
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,720
- Thanks, fellas.
- Be seeing you.

955
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:07,000
- What's wrong, sir?
- They're 36 hours behind schedule.

956
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,520
Lieutenant.

957
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,440
Sir.

958
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:33,040
We'll be turning you over
to the 82nd now.

959
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,520
They're good soldiers, the 82nd.

960
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,280
Just be sure you keep your hand
on your wallet at all times.

961
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,600
Yes, sir.

962
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,640
They're here.

963
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:38,480
It's 30 Corps.
They're here, chaps.

964
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:48,520
You're late, you lazy bastard,
but we'll forgive you!

965
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,360
That was gracious of me.

966
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:57,080
Take cover!
Bring up the Piat.

967
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,880
Make sure it's within range.

968
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:47,120
Come on! You'll miss him.

969
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:18,720
Right, lads! Go, go!

970
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,360
Corporal!

971
01:50:32,440 --> 01:50:34,400
I need a jeep.
Well done, laddie.

972
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:38,040
- We thought you were dead.
- I can assure you it was an error.

973
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:57,920
That was the bleeding general.

974
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:02,280
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

975
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:04,880
Carry on, thank you.
Good morning, Baker.

976
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,880
Good morning, James.

977
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,600
Harry. Apologies for
my enforced absence. Dennis.

978
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,720
- Sir.
- Lathbury's been put out of action.

979
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,280
I'd like you to go into town,
take over the brigade.

980
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:20,520
- How soon can you leave?
- Right away.

981
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:23,080
Pull them together and keep
pushing forward to the bridge.

982
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,000
Did the rest of the division
arrive safely?

983
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,160
Yes, but we've run into
all kinds of trouble.

984
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:30,520
It would seem that we've landed
on top of two S. S. panzer divisions.

985
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,680
Good God.

986
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,840
As you can imagine,
it's hard to stop tanks...

987
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,600
- with rifles and machine guns.
- Show me.

988
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:39,480
You can see what we're up against.

989
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:42,320
Johnny Frost and some of his chaps have
managed to get as far as the bridge.

990
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,960
But the Germans are driving
down here towards the river...

991
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,480
and may even now
have cut them off completely.

992
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,840
Now the entire division is here, we
should be able to break through to him.

993
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:55,600
It certainly gives us
more of a chance.

994
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:58,080
Sosabowski's Polish brigade
is due in at 12:00.

995
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:59,320
If it arrives.

996
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:02,280
Yesterday's airlift was three hours late
due to fog in England.

997
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,120
The gliders bringing the Poles'
equipment didn't arrive at all.

998
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:08,720
- Now give me the good news.
- I'm afraid there isn't any, sir.

999
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,760
As you can see,
we're more or less surrounded.

1000
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:15,560
So far we're holding our own, but we're
desperately short of food, medicine...

1001
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,840
and above all, ammunition.

1002
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,120
- Are we getting our daily supply drop?
- Oh, yes.

1003
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,160
The Royal Air Force
are flying in on schedule.

1004
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:26,960
The trouble is, the Germans
have overrun the dropping zones.

1005
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:30,160
- Don't our pilots know that?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

1006
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:31,720
In heaven's name, why?

1007
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,520
It's the radios, sir.

1008
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:40,880
We still haven't been able to make
contact with anyone outside Arnhem.

1009
01:52:56,640 --> 01:52:58,640
Fools!

1010
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,880
Bloody fools, this way!

1011
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,440
We're over here!

1012
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,440
We're here!

1013
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,280
- It's wide.
- Drop 'em over here.

1014
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:29,320
What the hell are they doing?
They must be able to see us.

1015
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:31,320
They can see us all right, laddie...

1016
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:34,280
but they're under orders
to ignore signals from the ground.

1017
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,280
For all they know,
we could be Germans.

1018
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,840
They're giving it all
to the bloody Germans.

1019
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,360
Charles.

1020
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,800
Poor bastard.

1021
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,640
Oh, well, maybe tomorrow.

1022
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:15,560
Here.

1023
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,800
He'll never make it.
Those bleeding snipers will get him.

1024
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,160
Come back!

1025
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,080
Come on, Ginger mate.

1026
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,480
- He'll never lift it.
- Come on, mate!

1027
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,680
Bring it back, mate.
Come on.

1028
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:02,200
Come on!

1029
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:07,760
Run, laddie, run!

1030
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:18,280
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1031
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:53,880
Taxi!

1032
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:11,360
- Do you get all that?
- She wants somebody to call her a taxi.

1033
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,040
Taxi.

1034
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:04,920
- Doctor.
- Good evening, Kate.

1035
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:09,440
May I introduce Mrs. ter Horst,
Colonel Weaver.

1036
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:13,080
Is your husband
not returned yet?

1037
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,880
He should have been here by now.

1038
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:18,520
He must be having difficulties
coming through the German lines.

1039
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:21,840
Well, in that case...

1040
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,600
we will have to ask you
for a decision.

1041
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,640
Colonel Weaver
has a request to make.

1042
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,200
What we've done is
we've set up...

1043
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:34,240
a defensive pocket,
more or less thumb shaped...

1044
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,280
with the river as the base.

1045
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:39,920
Mrs. ter Horst speaks
surprisingly good English, Colonel.

1046
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:43,520
Then you understand that we're
in quite a strong position...

1047
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:46,560
for holding out
until 30 Corps reaches us.

1048
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:49,560
But we have to make
certain arrangements.

1049
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,400
The words come through. I don't know
if I follow the military strategy.

1050
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,640
We have the main hospital, of course,
but it is full to bursting.

1051
01:58:00,640 --> 01:58:04,080
Perhaps you understand
that we have great need...

1052
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:06,080
of additional space.

1053
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,480
Our house would seem suitable.

1054
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,960
It's just for the slightly wounded.

1055
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,400
You know, we'll patch them up,
send them back... that sort of thing.

1056
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:25,400
I feel it will need
a little more than that.

1057
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,400
We're wasting time. Come.

1058
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:35,160
- Doctor.
- Thank you, Kate.

1059
01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:39,080
I will see you.
I will come back.

1060
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,760
You come in. Let's see.

1061
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:49,200
Please sit.
Come take this chair.

1062
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:55,400
- Come over here with me, lads.
- Thanks very much.

1063
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,400
Sit down.

1064
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,440
Let me help you.

1065
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:14,640
Oh, Colonel,
the major wants you upstairs, sir.

1066
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,640
Okay. Thank you.

1067
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,200
All right?

1068
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:30,240
Thank you.

1069
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:32,920
Still in one piece, Dodds?

1070
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,360
Good. All right, Potter?

1071
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,680
That's far enough!

1072
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,320
We can hear you from there.

1073
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:48,280
Rather an interesting
development, sir.

1074
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:53,760
My general says there is no point
in continuing this fighting.

1075
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:57,080
He is willing to discuss
a surrender.

1076
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:03,040
Tell him to go to hell.

1077
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:08,880
We haven't the proper facilities
to take you all prisoner!

1078
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,040
Sorry.

1079
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,720
What?

1080
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:16,840
We'd like to, but we can't
accept your surrender.

1081
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,440
Was there anything else?

1082
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:31,560
All right.

1083
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:57,840
And now?

1084
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:00,320
Flatten Arnhem.

1085
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:46,360
- Any movement at Nijmegen?
- None.

1086
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:48,040
No way of blasting through
to the bridge?

1087
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:51,720
I'd lose all my men for nothing. There's
God knows how many out there already.

1088
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,000
You mean it's over?

1089
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:55,600
I didn't say that, did I?

1090
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:57,640
We've paid for that bridge,
and we're going to collect.

1091
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:00,120
But to do it,
I need tank support.

1092
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:02,880
You've got it, Jimmy.

1093
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,400
The Grenadier Guards will be happy
to oblige. Is that all right, Alex?

1094
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,040
Absolutely.

1095
02:03:08,120 --> 02:03:10,600
It's not just tanks.
I need boats.

1096
02:03:10,680 --> 02:03:13,680
If 30 Corps were American, we would
have boats. Did you bring any?

1097
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,720
- Mike?
- We might have a few about somewhere.

1098
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:20,080
- Can you get them here by tonight?
- It won't be easy.

1099
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:22,920
We've got one road,
ten-mile traffic jams on it...

1100
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,960
and Germans throwing shells at us.

1101
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:28,560
-I don't know quite what we can do...
-Except try. You can do that, can't you?

1102
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:32,920
Thank you, gentlemen.
Now, look here.

1103
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,080
About these boats...

1104
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:38,080
What is your opinion?
How many?

1105
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:42,040
The general's a bit scratchy today,
but it's nothing personal.

1106
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:44,520
When we dropped on Sunday...

1107
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:46,960
I think he cracked his spine.

1108
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:59,400
- How many boats have we got then?
- About six in each truck.

1109
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:15,640
Where's Major Cook, soldier?

1110
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:19,240
- I think over there, sir.
- Thank you.

1111
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:36,280
Julian, where the hell are you?

1112
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,400
Here, sir.

1113
02:04:44,440 --> 02:04:46,680
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.

1114
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,680
- What's the best way to take a bridge?
- Both ends at once.

1115
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:54,600
I'm sending two companies
across the river by boat.

1116
02:04:54,680 --> 02:04:57,400
I need a man with
very special qualities to lead.

1117
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:00,360
Go on, sir.

1118
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:04,720
He's got to be tough enough
and experienced enough to do it.

1119
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,280
Plus one more thing.

1120
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:08,600
He's gotta be dumb enough to do it.

1121
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:11,800
Start getting ready.

1122
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:20,640
What was all that about?

1123
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:24,520
Well, someone's come up
with a real nightmare.

1124
02:05:30,160 --> 02:05:33,560
Come on! Keep moving!

1125
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:42,800
We just got word from
the Dutch Resistance people at Arnhem.

1126
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:45,640
- And?
- It's not going well for the British.

1127
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:47,760
Their main force
never reached the bridge.

1128
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,000
Those that did are hanging on
by their fingernails.

1129
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:52,480
- And General Urquhart?
- He's got his back to the river.

1130
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,360
The Germans trapped his men in a pocket
and they're squeezing it smaller.

1131
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:59,160
How long can he hold?

1132
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:02,800
Where are those goddamn boats?

1133
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,640
Just keep it clear.

1134
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:22,800
Right.

1135
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:25,400
They're no further
than we thought. Julian.

1136
02:06:25,480 --> 02:06:28,680
- Sir.
- There's been a change in plans.

1137
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:30,720
We're gonna make the crossing
in daylight.

1138
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:34,840
- Daylight.
- Traffic's all screwed up for miles.

1139
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,760
By the time we're ready,
it'll be 0800.

1140
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:39,680
- That's when we go.
- Fine.

1141
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:43,280
I'd like to wait and go tomorrow night,
but the British can't hold.

1142
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,920
Better by daylight.

1143
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,400
Much.

1144
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:58,760
- Any news of the boats?
- No. We're switching...

1145
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:01,520
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

1146
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:04,360
We're switching the start to 9:00
just to make sure.

1147
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,800
You start laying smoke
just before we go.

1148
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:09,080
Fine.

1149
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:11,480
They're going to get creamed
from the far embankment.

1150
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:15,000
Your smoke screen's gonna be
their only protection.

1151
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:17,560
Don't worry.
We'll cover you.

1152
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,000
Please.

1153
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:34,400
Okay, can I have
your attention, please?

1154
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:38,360
I'm pleased to inform you that our 9:00
departure has been postponed till 10:00.

1155
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:41,160
So you can all have
an extra hour's fun and relaxation.

1156
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,320
- Major?
- Yes.

1157
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,440
We got any more information
on those boats?

1158
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:50,520
We're reliably informed that they float.
Outside of that, we don't know squat.

1159
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:53,800
Not how many, not how heavy,
not how big.

1160
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:58,360
We are sure that the river is wide
and that the current is strong.

1161
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:02,240
As any more cheery information comes
my way, I'll be happy to pass it along.

1162
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:05,360
In the meantime, just think of this
as on-the-job training.

1163
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:11,520
What's the matter?
No sense of humor?

1164
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,360
Goddamn it!

1165
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:17,920
We go at noon.

1166
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:33,280
Come on. Clear those roads!

1167
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:09,480
You men are probably wondering
why I've called us here together.

1168
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:13,680
I've reached a decision
that I'd like to share with you all.

1169
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:18,640
I intend to go across
like George Washington...

1170
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:20,920
standing on the prow.

1171
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,480
You guys can do the rowing.

1172
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:33,440
- That's it! Move 'em out!
- Here we go!

1173
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,440
Get up there, guys.

1174
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:45,080
It's heavy.

1175
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,040
What the...

1176
02:09:51,120 --> 02:09:54,560
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload 'em.

1177
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:01,000
Easy on them, guys.

1178
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:15,440
- How many more?
- Get those sides up.

1179
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:17,280
Fire!

1180
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,400
What else can you see
besides smoke?

1181
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:29,920
Nothing yet, but they are
going to try a river assault.

1182
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:32,440
It will fail.

1183
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:35,160
Of course it will fail, but...

1184
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:38,200
what do we do
if it doesn't?

1185
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:40,840
I ask your permission
to blow up the bridge.

1186
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,440
Out of the question.

1187
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:47,640
I understand, Field Marshal.

1188
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:52,000
They will not cross the river
and we will blow no bridges.

1189
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:53,800
Have all demolition charges
been checked?

1190
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:56,680
Yes, sir.
Everything is wired and ready.

1191
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,520
Captain Krafft
is standing by as ordered.

1192
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:04,320
The bridge will not
fall into enemy hands.

1193
02:11:05,360 --> 02:11:07,920
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...

1194
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,960
I'll blow it sky-high.

1195
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:26,920
- Let's get going!
- All right! Go, go, go!

1196
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,240
Go on. Don't wait. Go.

1197
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:04,160
Jump in, boys.

1198
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:13,920
If you don't have an oar,
use your rifle butts, anything.

1199
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:15,520
Row!

1200
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,800
One, two.

1201
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:52,760
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right.

1202
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:02,640
- Support fire ordered, sir.
- Right. Thank you.

1203
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:26,200
Get down!

1204
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:41,000
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1205
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:25,520
We're drifting!
Pull to your left!

1206
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:27,960
Pull!

1207
02:14:29,440 --> 02:14:31,880
Keep it going, boys.
Keep rowing.

1208
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:41,680
Stay down.

1209
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:46,720
Come on, boys.

1210
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,440
Thy will be done.

1211
02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:12,200
Come on. Let's go.

1212
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,200
Let's go!

1213
02:15:29,800 --> 02:15:31,080
Snipers!

1214
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:45,600
Help me.

1215
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:06,920
Go up the side.

1216
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:18,800
Second platoon!

1217
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:21,400
- Can we make it through the tunnel?
- No way, sir.

1218
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:25,840
Up the bank.

1219
02:16:40,560 --> 02:16:42,000
Cover.

1220
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:52,040
Come on.

1221
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:37,360
Sergeant.

1222
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:40,320
Take four across, draw fire.
Harry and I'll go up the side.

1223
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:41,720
You cover.

1224
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:43,160
Go, go, go!

1225
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,680
Come on.

1226
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:52,400
Let's go!

1227
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,360
Are you ready?

1228
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:15,600
Yes, General.

1229
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:34,480
Goddamn it.

1230
02:19:24,040 --> 02:19:27,320
My God, they're only
18 kilometers from Arnhem.

1231
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:30,880
Who can stop them now?

1232
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:34,520
No one.

1233
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:07,840
Oh, hell.

1234
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:09,840
Any chance, Whitney?

1235
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,000
No, sir, not unless we're relieved
in the next few hours.

1236
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:14,040
Harry?

1237
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:17,200
- Try and get him down to the cellar.
- Very good, sir.

1238
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:44,400
It's working.

1239
02:20:44,440 --> 02:20:46,400
I'm through to H. Q.
Where's the colonel?

1240
02:20:46,480 --> 02:20:47,840
- Down below.
- Get him.

1241
02:20:47,880 --> 02:20:50,400
- Colonel Frost!
- What is it?

1242
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:52,400
Up top.

1243
02:20:55,320 --> 02:20:57,680
It's Headquarters, sir,
on the radio.

1244
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:58,840
Coming.

1245
02:21:02,480 --> 02:21:05,880
Sunray on set.
Pass your message. Over.

1246
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:08,440
What's your situation, Johnny?
Over.

1247
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:11,240
I hadn't expected
the pleasure, sir.

1248
02:21:11,320 --> 02:21:13,400
We are holding out.

1249
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:19,000
We need reinforcements
and above all, ammunition. Over.

1250
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,920
I'm not sure if it's a case
of us coming for you...

1251
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,320
or you coming for us.

1252
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:27,280
Well, we'll just wait
for 30 Corps then.

1253
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:29,120
That would probably be best.

1254
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:31,880
Very reassuring
talking to you, sir.

1255
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:36,400
I'm sorry, Johnny, getting stuck
on that bloody bridge...

1256
02:21:36,480 --> 02:21:38,880
four days on your own.

1257
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:40,320
Have you anything else for me?

1258
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:44,320
No, sir. I'll give you a call
when our friends arrive. Over.

1259
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:46,880
All right.

1260
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:49,960
Good luck. Out.

1261
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:58,960
- Sergeant Tomblin!
- Here, sir.

1262
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:00,720
I'm coming over.

1263
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:05,280
Sergeant Taylor!

1264
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,400
I don't understand.
Why aren't you moving?

1265
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:20,040
What's the matter with you guys?

1266
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,160
Those are British troops
at Arnhem.

1267
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,320
They're hurt bad.

1268
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:28,480
You're not gonna stop,
not now.

1269
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:30,920
I'm sorry.
We have our orders.

1270
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,600
We busted our asses getting here.
Half my men are killed.

1271
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:36,440
You're just gonna stop...

1272
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:39,240
and drink tea?

1273
02:22:39,320 --> 02:22:41,720
We're now facing a completely
different situation.

1274
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,640
We can't lead with tanks up that road.
Jerry'll pick us off like sitting ducks.

1275
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:49,440
Our infantry is fighting in Nijmegen.
When they get here, we'll move on.

1276
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:57,440
For Christ's sake, must you
do everything by the book?

1277
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,880
Our orders are to wait
for the infantry.

1278
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,400
I'm sorry, but there it is.

1279
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:16,920
It's Major Carlyle, sir.

1280
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:32,920
All right. I'm all right.

1281
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:48,720
Things are not so good, eh?

1282
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:57,560
I've been meaning
to ask you something...

1283
02:23:57,640 --> 02:24:01,200
and I haven't because I know
you were so anxious that I should...

1284
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:05,880
and I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1285
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:13,400
Why the hell do you always carry
that bloody umbrella?

1286
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:17,960
- Memory.
- What?

1287
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:20,800
Bad memory.

1288
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:25,920
Always forgot the password.

1289
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,320
I knew no Jerry...

1290
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:33,600
would ever carry one.

1291
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:39,040
I had...

1292
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:43,040
to prove I was an Englishman.

1293
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:13,000
Get back!
Back into the houses.

1294
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,520
30 Corps, please hurry.

1295
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,640
- Nothing, sir.
- All right. Thank you, Corporal.

1296
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:41,520
It's no use in any event.
Take my boot off, will you, Wicks?

1297
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:44,200
Hello, 30 Corps.

1298
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:46,800
Oh, God!

1299
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:54,360
We're out of ammunition anyway.

1300
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:58,720
Right. Off you go, Wicks.
Join the rest of the lads.

1301
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:00,440
Try and get back
to the main force.

1302
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:02,600
- What about you, sir?
- I'll be all right.

1303
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:06,440
We just didn't make it
this time, did we?

1304
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:16,400
Calling 30 Corps.
Come in, please.

1305
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:29,800
My general says
please take it.

1306
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:31,800
It's very good chocolate.

1307
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:34,400
Your planes dropped it to us
yesterday.

1308
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:49,080
English.

1309
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:04,840
Action stations!

1310
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:08,080
God bless
Field Marshal Montgomery.

1311
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:56,280
Would five minutes
be too much?

1312
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,960
Just five minutes respite.

1313
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:06,240
Dear God...

1314
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,760
grant these young men...

1315
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:13,360
die in peace and quiet.

1316
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:39,200
I'm sorry, lads,
but you're going to have to move.

1317
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:50,200
Please.

1318
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:54,040
Take my hand.

1319
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:58,680
We're a bit late
with this one, mate.

1320
02:31:06,360 --> 02:31:10,080
"Surely He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler...

1321
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:14,040
and from the noisome pestilence.

1322
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:16,920
He shall cover thee
with His feather...

1323
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,840
and under His wings
shalt thou trust.

1324
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:23,240
His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler."

1325
02:31:42,400 --> 02:31:44,720
There you go. Head back.

1326
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:48,400
You'll be all right now, chum.

1327
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:57,640
Can it get worse?

1328
02:31:57,720 --> 02:32:00,880
Oh, yes, much worse.

1329
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:19,760
Bring up the bulldozer.

1330
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,680
Stretcher bearer!

1331
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:37,320
Help me!

1332
02:32:38,880 --> 02:32:40,120
Stretcher.

1333
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:46,040
Easy, now. Take it easy.

1334
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:50,200
Morphia. I must have morphia.

1335
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:53,440
Morphia is only for
the people who are really hurt.

1336
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:56,040
I thought I was really hurt.

1337
02:32:56,120 --> 02:32:58,040
Well, you're wrong.

1338
02:32:59,240 --> 02:33:02,440
I asked him to come over,
but Dr. Spaander does agree with me.

1339
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:05,720
- We've got to do something about them.
- Yes, what? Good day, Doctor.

1340
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:10,880
General Urquhart, we have no more space
and we have no more supplies.

1341
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:13,320
And since a prisoner of war...

1342
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:15,640
has more chance
than no chance at all...

1343
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:18,080
I have a mind
to ask the Germans...

1344
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:20,920
to accept our wounded
into their hospitals...

1345
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,840
if we could arrange evacuation.

1346
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:27,200
- Have I your permission to try?
- Certainly.

1347
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:30,880
If Weaver agrees.
But I hardly think the Germans will.

1348
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:35,320
Those are our guns out there.
That's 30 Corps.

1349
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:38,680
I don't think my permission
is going to be your major problem.

1350
02:33:49,880 --> 02:33:51,920
I've come with a message
from General Urquhart.

1351
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
How you manage that?

1352
02:33:54,080 --> 02:33:56,560
I swam the Rhine, sir.

1353
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:59,720
I'm afraid the radios
are all up the spout.

1354
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:03,560
The general asks if you'll
get your men across the river.

1355
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:06,840
We've been holding out
for six days now.

1356
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:09,640
Any help at all would be
of considerable assistance.

1357
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:12,800
You swim back with reply?

1358
02:34:12,880 --> 02:34:14,080
Yes, sir.

1359
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:17,960
Well, we can't swim...

1360
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,400
not with equipment.

1361
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:23,240
We have small rubber boats,
that's all.

1362
02:34:23,320 --> 02:34:25,960
I'm afraid rubber dinghies
may be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir.

1363
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:28,000
I agree.

1364
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:35,840
Tell the general we're coming.

1365
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:38,040
We're coming tonight.

1366
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:40,040
Yes, sir.

1367
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:35,840
Not possible.

1368
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:40,480
If you would just say yes,
it would be very possible.

1369
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:43,880
Forgive me,
but there is a battle...

1370
02:37:43,960 --> 02:37:46,280
and we are in the process
of winning it.

1371
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:50,920
Winning and losing
is not our concern.

1372
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,880
Living or dying is.

1373
02:37:55,640 --> 02:37:58,040
Cease fire...

1374
02:37:58,080 --> 02:38:01,280
one more hour, two...

1375
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:03,720
just to evacuate our wounded.

1376
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:09,680
Afterwards you can kill us
as much as you want to.

1377
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:17,560
General Ludwig.

1378
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:00,800
- Will you thank him, please?
- I just did.

1379
02:39:01,680 --> 02:39:04,160
Please, you can go.

1380
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,760
How short are we? A mile?

1381
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:48,680
Why don't we just try
to bash through?

1382
02:40:48,760 --> 02:40:51,400
For God's sake,
it must be worth it.

1383
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:54,680
They're trying to force Urquhart
away from the river.

1384
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:58,320
Now, once they do that...

1385
02:40:58,400 --> 02:41:02,320
once they've got him surrounded,
he'll be annihilated.

1386
02:41:02,400 --> 02:41:04,520
Not in Monty's plan at all.

1387
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:08,160
Have we replaced the boats
we lost at Nijmegen?

1388
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:11,040
Yes.

1389
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:14,000
Well?

1390
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:18,040
Well, then?

1391
02:41:24,400 --> 02:41:27,560
Well, that's it then.
We're pulling them out.

1392
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:35,880
It was Nijmegen.

1393
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:40,520
It was the single road
getting to Nijmegen.

1394
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:42,880
No, it was after Nijmegen.

1395
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:48,560
And the fog...

1396
02:41:48,640 --> 02:41:50,520
in England.

1397
02:41:54,880 --> 02:41:57,640
It doesn't matter what it was.

1398
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:00,600
When one man says to another,
"Today let's play the war game"...

1399
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:04,760
everybody dies.

1400
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:09,760
"Withdraw"?

1401
02:42:12,480 --> 02:42:15,560
Two days, they said.
We've been here nine.

1402
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:19,920
One bloody mile. You'd think
they could accomplish that.

1403
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:24,080
- Hancock, here are another two.
- All right. Thank you.

1404
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:26,600
They're the last two
I could find.

1405
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:28,800
Charles?

1406
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:31,800
We've been given
our marching orders.

1407
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:37,080
If they discover we're leaving,
they'll go all out to destroy us.

1408
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:39,440
So we must take every precaution.

1409
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:42,320
I've designed this
like a collapsing bag.

1410
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:44,760
Macdonald here has agreed
to man the wireless...

1411
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:46,920
in order to give the Germans
something to listen to.

1412
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:51,200
All the padres and medical staff
have volunteered to stay behind as well.

1413
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:53,480
Now, the wounded
who are too bad to move...

1414
02:42:53,560 --> 02:42:55,960
will replace the men firing...

1415
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:58,720
so our defense
will seem as before.

1416
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:01,040
By the time the Germans
find out what's happening...

1417
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:04,080
we should all be safely
across the river.

1418
02:43:05,480 --> 02:43:08,280
- Pleasant journey.
- Thank you, sir.

1419
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:40,280
- Are you all right, laddie?
- Thank you, sir.

1420
02:45:03,800 --> 02:45:07,360
I'm beginning to believe
we're actually going to make it, sir.

1421
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:09,440
I thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.

1422
02:45:43,640 --> 02:45:45,640
Come on. Don't hang about.

1423
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:49,840
General Browning will be down
right away, sir.

1424
02:46:56,080 --> 02:47:00,040
He wondered if you perhaps
might like to change.

1425
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:02,680
- Change?
- Your clothes, sir.

1426
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:06,720
No, thanks.

1427
02:47:22,680 --> 02:47:24,640
Hello, Roy.

1428
02:47:27,440 --> 02:47:28,520
How are you?

1429
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:33,240
I'm not sure
that I'll know for a while.

1430
02:47:34,520 --> 02:47:36,400
But I'm sorry about
the way it worked out.

1431
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:40,320
You did all you could.

1432
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:44,920
Yes, but did everyone else?

1433
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:50,840
They've got a bed for you upstairs,
if you want it.

1434
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:55,360
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.

1435
02:47:55,440 --> 02:47:57,800
I've come out with less than 2,000.

1436
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:00,400
I don't feel much like sleeping.

1437
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:02,800
Quite.

1438
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:08,600
I've just been on to Monty.

1439
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:10,880
He's very proud and pleased.

1440
02:48:12,040 --> 02:48:14,080
- Pleased?
- Of course.

1441
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:19,040
He thinks Market Garden
was 90% successful.

1442
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:22,960
But what do you think?

1443
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:28,720
Well, as you know, I've always thought
we tried to go a bridge too far.

1444
02:49:00,240 --> 02:49:01,680
Mind his head.

1445
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:08,480
Thanks, Taff.

1446
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:19,840
Abide with me

1447
02:50:19,880 --> 02:50:22,440
Fast falls

1448
02:50:22,520 --> 02:50:27,600
The eventide

1449
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:31,160
The darkness

1450
02:50:31,240 --> 02:50:34,040
Deepens

1451
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:39,880
Lord, with me abide

1452
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:43,280
When other

1453
02:50:43,360 --> 02:50:47,040
Helpers fail

1454
02:50:47,120 --> 02:50:50,720
And comforts flee

1455
02:50:52,400 --> 02:50:57,000
Help of the helpless

1456
02:50:57,080 --> 02:51:00,520
O abide

1457
02:51:00,600 --> 02:51:04,080
With me

1458
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:11,800
Hold Thou Thy cross

1459
02:51:11,880 --> 02:51:17,320
Before my closing eyes

1460
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:23,640
Shine through the gloom



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
