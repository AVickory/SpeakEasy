1
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,617
Please, turn it off.
Melinda, come on, please.

2
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:49,678
- God damn.
- ( siren wailing )

3
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:57,787
Forget about it,
it happens.

4
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,697
- Not to me, it doesn't.
- lt's probably just the booze, Max.

5
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:04,965
You've been hitting it
pretty hard lately.

6
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:07,665
Forget about it, huh?

7
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:10,140
- What?
- l said forget about it.

8
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,007
Yeah, l guess.

9
00:01:15,648 --> 00:01:17,138
( zips )

10
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,846
Oh, here.

11
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:26,823
- So, l'll see you next week?
- Yeah, l guess.

12
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:34,925
( men speaking Russian )

13
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:38,402
She takes too long.

14
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:42,701
M-- Melinda--

15
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:51,574
- l was--
- Yeah? What?

16
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:57,351
Fuck it.
Forget it, never mind.

17
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,789
Never mind, forget it.
Fuck it.

18
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,026
Go on, Max, it's--

19
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:08,725
l'll-- l'll see you next week, okay?

20
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,359
Okay. Okay, sorry.

21
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,105
You got a light?

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,151
Were you in the Gulf?

23
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:34,725
Gulf, Afghanistan,

24
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,591
Vietnam.

25
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,221
My father served in Afghanistan.

26
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:41,790
He died in '88,
killed by a sniper

27
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:44,064
outside Mazar-i Sharif.

28
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:47,732
Sorry to hear that, son.

29
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:50,139
There's a war still going on.

30
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:56,373
( grunts )
What the fu--

31
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:22,305
Max:
All my life, l've been a donkey...

32
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:26,169
standing an equal distance
between two--

33
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:28,008
two bundles of hay.

34
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,742
Now the hay is disappearing.

35
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,785
And so are my choices.

36
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:39,184
Oh, man. l haven't slept in three,
maybe four days. l don't know.

37
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:42,287
But, finally now
my mind is clear.

38
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:44,023
Oh, yes.

39
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:45,894
Today is lndependence Day--
my lndependence Day.

40
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,925
Yeah.

41
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,765
Finally, l will choose--

42
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:55,740
somewhere, maybe here,
right here,

43
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:57,298
today-- tonight.

44
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:00,505
You know, there's just
nothing left to keep me here.

45
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:03,777
Nothing. l am so full.
And l'm so empty.

46
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,444
Today-- bang!

47
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,548
Ain't no more foolishness.

48
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:14,147
Then of course, a tombstone,
an epitaph, all that bullshit.

49
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:16,252
But l will not go quietly.

50
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:19,890
l will not go gently
into that dark night.

51
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,763
Not me, not like that.

52
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:24,860
l want to leave a mark
of my presence.

53
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:26,598
l want people to remember me.

54
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,197
l want her to tell her children

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,572
''Max Walker-- he existed.''

56
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,775
l existed. l existed.

57
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,474
Just a handful of mistakes
away from glory.

58
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:45,780
l hope you understand.

59
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:49,958
But if you don't, well then...

60
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:53,998
too bad for you.

61
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,898
Too bad for you.

62
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:00,922
( beeps )

63
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:04,286
Okay.

64
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,194
( knocks )
Cheers.

65
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,365
Story of my life.

66
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:14,895
Anyway...

67
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,939
l've made a decision.

68
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:22,643
l'm finally in control
of something.

69
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,649
No more ''what ifs'' or ''if only's,''
you know?

70
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:27,912
The measure of a great man,
l think,

71
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:30,012
is in his ability to take control.

72
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:34,651
To tell the truth
and face the truth.

73
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:38,723
To put the record straight.

74
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,664
To be heard--
my ex-wife, my boss,

75
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,497
my foolish...

76
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:47,667
empty existence.

77
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:49,901
One final day to face my fears.

78
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:53,403
A defining moment.
( laughs )

79
00:07:55,013 --> 00:07:56,776
Oh.

80
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,808
My last cigarette.

81
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:03,083
l sure hope l enjoy it.

82
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,780
Who would imagine it being
the tug of a last cigarette, no?

83
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,093
My name is Max Walker
and l have arrived

84
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:13,029
at the final turning point
of my life.

85
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,501
Here l am to brighten your day.

86
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:22,330
- Hey, l have to make a phone call.
- ( dialing )

87
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:26,202
Never learned how to speed dial.

88
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,644
Bud!

89
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:30,572
Yeah, l-- l need you today.

90
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:36,483
Max:
Hey better late than never.

91
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,785
- l thought you were never gonna come.
- What are you doing?

92
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:40,758
Why are you filming me?

93
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,783
- Take the camera. Here.
- No.

94
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:44,989
Come here.
Take the camera.

95
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,328
- You gonna tell me what's going on?
- Take the camera, please, okay?

96
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:50,096
Bud: Fine. All right.
What do you want me to do?

97
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:51,796
You want to be a big director, right?

98
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,532
Want to be a big shot?

99
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:55,870
This is your big chance, okay?
No. No no no.

100
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:58,433
l want you to film me.

101
00:08:58,477 --> 00:08:59,967
- All right.
- Here we go.

102
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:01,843
Shoot me from low down, man,
come on.

103
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,745
Yeah, that's it, that's it.
Let me see.

104
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:05,909
What do you want me to do?
What is this, a day in the life?

105
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,851
Not quite, it's the--

106
00:09:07,886 --> 00:09:09,513
the last day of a life.

107
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:11,146
The last-- it's the end of a life.

108
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:13,350
And this is the last--
you'll be film--

109
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:15,223
What the fuck are you talking about?

110
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,955
lt's the end of a life.
The last day in a life.

111
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,656
The end of my life.

112
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,187
And l want you to film it.

113
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:21,893
What the fuck you talking about?

114
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:25,901
Today, l'm the actor,
believe it or not.

115
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:28,495
l'm the star.

116
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,098
And l want you to film it.

117
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,337
l want you
to film the last day of my life.

118
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,777
Max, this isn't--
this isn't funny.

119
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:36,542
- This isn't clever, okay?
- Oh, come on.

120
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:38,208
- No no. lt's nuts.
- Bud.

121
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,774
What the fuck?
You know what?

122
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:41,649
- You're really losing it, know that?
- Oh, come on.

123
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:44,417
- l'm sorry.
- Oh, come on, please.

124
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,151
Bud, it's a joke.

125
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,926
Fuck it.

126
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,408
- Please.
- You can't do this to me.

127
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,342
Even as a joke,
it's not fair, Max.

128
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:07,106
l swear to God,
l'll get this thing done.

129
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,113
l'm gonna get this thing done,
you know?

130
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:10,739
With you or without you.

131
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:13,307
Come on,
it's not just talk this time.

132
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,411
Why do you think l want you
to film me, Bud?

133
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:18,719
lt's my gift to you.

134
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,055
You-- you'll be famous.

135
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,754
You'll be a somebody,
instead of a--

136
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:25,760
instead of a nobody, like me.

137
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,456
l mean, you have everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

138
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,296
l--

139
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,564
l'm begging you as a friend.

140
00:10:38,543 --> 00:10:40,306
Bud, please.

141
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:48,549
Give me the camera.

142
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,248
Really?

143
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:53,654
( sniffs )
Thanks.

144
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,183
Okay.

145
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:57,718
- Thanks.
- Okay, Max.

146
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,958
- What should we do?
- Let's go.

147
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:01,693
Okay.

148
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,431
Okay.

149
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:11,135
So, there it is--

150
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:12,666
this.

151
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,241
This will be my liberation.

152
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:19,148
- How long you gonna keep this up?
- Until l pull the trigger.

153
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,353
Come on, Jesus Christ.
Keep filming. Come on.

154
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:23,911
Come on.

155
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:27,355
- You really are crazy, aren't you?
- What do you think?

156
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:38,201
Let's take the stairs.
Come on.

157
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:40,033
Come on.

158
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:41,937
But very cinematic, okay?

159
00:11:41,973 --> 00:11:43,736
You know, maybe you
could animate this part.

160
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:46,266
Um-- oh, l know. Hold on.

161
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,772
l-- l never had a nickname.

162
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,374
You know, like Curly, Fats

163
00:11:52,417 --> 00:11:54,214
or, you know, Slim.

164
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,778
There were-- there were two kinds
of kids who didn't have nicknames.

165
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,586
There were the--
the ones on top

166
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:01,683
and then there were
the invisible ones like me.

167
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:05,093
You know? l guess l just
wasn't worth the trouble.

168
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,825
You know what l mean?

169
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:12,396
l remember,
there was this--

170
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,637
this boy--
aw, forget it.

171
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,506
No, tell me.

172
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,568
- What?
- The boy.

173
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:25,943
- Seems you want to talk about it.
- Okay. Okay.

174
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,250
Okay, there was this boy.

175
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,521
He was a lot like me.
He was--

176
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:38,461
he was harmless
and insignificant.

177
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:42,427
And, um--

178
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,231
Fuck!

179
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,136
All right, l remember this day.

180
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:54,941
They were picking on him

181
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,005
and for some insane reason
l joined in.

182
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,606
And l punched him...

183
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,751
again and again and again
until he fell down.

184
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,618
And it seemed like
he was looking up at me

185
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,283
and saying,
''Why are you doing this?

186
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:07,985
You're just like me.''

187
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,661
And then they made me
part of their group.

188
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:14,722
Suddenly l had a girlfriend,
welcome to the world.

189
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:16,256
Fuck it.

190
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:22,929
( crying )

191
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:28,037
- Bud: lt's okay, Max.
- Oh, shit. Fast forward.

192
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:36,211
Okay, eventually, l fell in love.

193
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,586
l fell in love with Carla...

194
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:43,523
and she got pregnant.

195
00:13:44,563 --> 00:13:47,396
And then she, you know,

196
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:49,832
disappeared.

197
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:51,392
- What do you mean?
- What?

198
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:52,960
She disappeared?

199
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,131
One of those days--

200
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:56,731
forget it.

201
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,969
- Wait.
- Oh, stop.

202
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,404
She disappeared, okay?

203
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:05,712
l was-- l was-- l went crazy about it.
l panicked.

204
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:10,309
ln those days they took girls
like that away from where they were.

205
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:12,789
Then-- then she returned
and she told me she had a miscarriage,

206
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,054
but l know and l'm sure
she had an abortion.

207
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:19,224
And l was heartbroken.

208
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:20,993
- Okay? You satisfied?
- Bud: Okay.

209
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,192
- Okay.
- Leave me alone, God damn it.

210
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,467
Hey, you-- you're the one
who wanted to do this.

211
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:31,899
( sighs )

212
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:33,968
Then she didn't talk to me
for a long time.

213
00:14:38,183 --> 00:14:40,208
College.

214
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:45,715
This guy had a flair for words.

215
00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:47,850
l was clever.

216
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:52,787
Very romantic, for me.

217
00:14:52,831 --> 00:14:55,356
Very romantic for her, l guess,
to be involved with a struggling writer.

218
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:06,600
We got married.

219
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:10,481
lt's the only time
l ever remember being happy.

220
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,178
Even after all the bullshit
in the graphic novels...

221
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:21,749
l became a proofreader.

222
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:26,521
lmagine that.

223
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,295
A fuckin' foot servant of the literati.

224
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:39,940
Okay. The last 20 years
of my life have been

225
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:42,970
a blur of disappointment
and endless repetition

226
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:45,608
punctuated only by Carla
leaving me.

227
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,744
Now you'd think that would have
woken me up, but no.

228
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:51,381
l stayed asleep until now.

229
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:55,925
But today l am finally awake.

230
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,450
- Now what?
- Let's go.

231
00:15:57,495 --> 00:15:59,258
Outside? Okay.

232
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,164
Here you go. Come on.
l want to show you something.

233
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:05,260
Turn it off.

234
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:07,362
Yeah, we're not
gonna need it out here.

235
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:10,604
- What are you doing?
- Extra batteries, you got 'em?

236
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,303
Okay, good.

237
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,206
- Hey, you want this?
- Huh?

238
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,747
l don't need your car, Max.

239
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:23,652
What? My car just isn't
hip enough for you, is it, Buddy?

240
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:26,384
No. A Mercedes SUV.

241
00:16:26,424 --> 00:16:28,153
lt's all the bitch left me,
come on.

242
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:30,923
- l said l don't want it.
- Fine, fuck it. Okay.

243
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:33,760
Hey! Hey, man. Hey, boys.

244
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:36,028
( hip-hop music playing )

245
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:37,796
You see how the world is?
Violence is everywhere.

246
00:16:37,836 --> 00:16:39,633
This is not a good-- Max--

247
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:42,663
Oh no, man. You're not gonna need that.
Not with me, man.

248
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,403
You see that car?

249
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:49,640
lt's for you.

250
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:52,841
What the fuck's going on, man?

251
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:54,317
lt's not important.

252
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,316
l just don't need it anymore, okay?

253
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:00,347
- ( cocks )
- Hey, listen, son!

254
00:17:00,392 --> 00:17:03,486
l'm just trying to give you
a motherfucking car, man. Be cool.

255
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:06,525
- What?
- Tell him to turn that off.

256
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:08,293
- lt's off.
- No, hey!

257
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,358
- Turn off the fucking camera now!
- Shut the fuck up!

258
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:12,700
lf he doesn't, what are you gonna do?
You gonna kill him too?

259
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:15,262
Listen, son.

260
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:18,833
l'm just trying to give you a car.

261
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:20,435
My car.

262
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:22,105
lf you don't want it, fine.

263
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:24,012
Fuck yourself.

264
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:26,949
But l need to tell you something.

265
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,545
You're dealing with a man

266
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:32,112
who has absolutely
nothing left to lose.

267
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:36,024
You know what they say?

268
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,790
They say reactions
are the last thing to go.

269
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:43,399
Kinda makes you wonder,
doesn't it?

270
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:45,596
So here we are.
( whistling )

271
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:50,563
Huh? Huh?!
Here we are!

272
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:53,233
Mexican standoff.

273
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:55,877
Huh?

274
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:58,644
What's it gonna be?

275
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,241
Look, be cool, man.

276
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:01,912
Diplomacy.

277
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:05,555
You can walk away
with a Merc.

278
00:18:07,258 --> 00:18:09,021
Or...

279
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:12,119
my face might be
the last one you ever see.

280
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,689
What do you say?

281
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:23,206
Do yourself a favor.

282
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:24,731
Be cool.
Here you go.

283
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:27,869
Allow me.

284
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:31,311
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

285
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:38,388
Oh. Excuse me.
lf you wouldn't mind,

286
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:39,913
my wife's gloves.

287
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,018
Here, l want to burn these, okay?
Keep them for me.

288
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:44,892
( car starts )

289
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:47,721
Bye-bye.

290
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:59,073
Did you get that?
Did you shoot that shit?

291
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,737
- Did you--
- l was filming!

292
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:04,373
- l was filming the whole time!
- That was brilliant cinema.

293
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:07,384
- That was--
- My fucking liberation has begun.

294
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:10,148
My liberation has begun.
And this is the world l'm leaving!

295
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,421
You really gonna drink all those?

296
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:21,227
( grunts )
Every last one.

297
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,695
Think you should be relying on
Dutch courage on such an important day?

298
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:28,930
Dutch courage--
l'm impressed.

299
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,066
But a very unpleasant term,
Buddy. Huh?

300
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,437
Coined by the British
in the 17th century,

301
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,470
first used by the Royal Navy
in their disagreements

302
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:39,210
with the Dutch East
lndia Company.

303
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,549
An obscure fact--
and l'm full of 'em, man.

304
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:48,655
l suppose what you're really
asking me is if l'm brave enough

305
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:51,253
to finish out my plan.

306
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:53,457
And you know what?
lt's a very silly question.

307
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,561
l have never been brave enough

308
00:19:56,601 --> 00:19:58,762
to do or finish anything

309
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,600
unaided, okay?

310
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:04,766
lt's just something
to steady my resolve.

311
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:10,171
Steady my resolve.

312
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,916
Nothing more.

313
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:16,420
You know, help me finish
something l started.

314
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:18,979
Finish something, man,
for the first time in my life.

315
00:20:19,023 --> 00:20:20,547
Okay?

316
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:22,184
Just think of me as a poet or--

317
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:26,229
l'm a rock star.
Say, um-- Coleridge

318
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:29,927
or Kurt Cobain
doing their best work

319
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:31,936
under the influence.

320
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,798
So your best work is gonna be...

321
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,600
blowing your own head off?

322
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,838
Eureka. You're beginning
to understand.

323
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:44,137
Let's not talk about this
anymore, okay?

324
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:45,672
Please.

325
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:49,952
Just messing around.

326
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,785
l think l may have had
a little too much of that,

327
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,587
whatever it's called--
dark courage.

328
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,186
- Dutch--
- Dutch courage.

329
00:20:58,229 --> 00:21:00,026
Yeah, you have.

330
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:04,025
What are you doing?
Follow me.

331
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:06,993
What?

332
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:08,562
l'm not going in there.

333
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,233
Oh, come on,
don't be such a baby.

334
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:13,243
This is the grit.
Come on, Bud, this is art.

335
00:21:13,277 --> 00:21:14,767
This-- this is art.
Come on, boy.

336
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:16,609
Courage! Courage!

337
00:21:19,117 --> 00:21:20,846
l've had enough, Max.

338
00:21:20,885 --> 00:21:22,512
Enough of what?
What are you talking about?

339
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:24,487
l am not gonna film you
taking a piss.

340
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:26,353
Why not?
lt's cinema verite.

341
00:21:26,391 --> 00:21:28,484
And who did that?

342
00:21:28,526 --> 00:21:31,120
- Jean Cocteau.
- Okay, great.

343
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:34,426
Go take a piss.

344
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,695
This is what-- hey, Bud.
This is what you need

345
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,292
to get that scholarship to NYU.

346
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:41,100
Oh, so you taking a piss
is what l need?

347
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,606
Cocteau's what l need?
l can get a scholarship on my own, Max.

348
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,434
l don't need a fucking trick.

349
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:50,106
Bullshit.
You need a ''Blair Witch.''

350
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:53,608
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

351
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:55,175
And you're not it.

352
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:57,119
Hey, look, it's not about talent.

353
00:21:57,155 --> 00:21:59,055
Buddy, it's not about talent.
lt's about business.

354
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,217
And l just remembered,
you're a filmmaker

355
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,124
so you couldn't possibly be
a real artist anyway.

356
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,162
- Fuck you.
- What?

357
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:13,500
You're a fucking coward.

358
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,473
- Stop it.
- You were never

359
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:18,168
gonna go through with this.

360
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,405
Gonna kill yourself?

361
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,505
What a fucking joke.

362
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:25,675
You've wasted
enough of my day, Max.

363
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:28,379
Bud, Bud, Bud, look.
l'm sorry-- l'm sorry l said that stuff.

364
00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:30,148
l'm sorry l said that stuff.
Come on, Bud.

365
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:32,156
- Yeah?
- l didn't mean it!

366
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,249
Come on, relax.
Just relax, Bud.

367
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,919
- l'm out of here.
- l was just kidding around.

368
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,155
Come on! Fuck!

369
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,595
Buddy, l'm sorry l said that stuff.

370
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:43,832
Why did l say that stuff?

371
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,426
God!

372
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:01,543
Fuck.

373
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:12,691
( flushes )

374
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:16,733
Shh.

375
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:19,733
( grunting )

376
00:23:20,872 --> 00:23:24,273
( water running )

377
00:23:24,308 --> 00:23:26,538
( gasps )
Come on! Come on!

378
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:29,569
lt's a shakedown.
lt's a shakedown, for sure.

379
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,241
- What?
- Shh.

380
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:35,981
- You said it was cool, man.
- Okay okay.

381
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,612
We're like rats in a trap here.

382
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:39,054
Okay?

383
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,387
Frank, you gotta trust me.

384
00:23:42,426 --> 00:23:44,986
- l'm not gonna get fuckin' arrested.
- Okay. Shh.

385
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,621
We gotta rush him.

386
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:49,189
Okay?
We're gonna rush him.

387
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:51,326
On three, okay?

388
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,072
- One...
- Fuckin' towels.

389
00:23:58,109 --> 00:23:59,667
...two...

390
00:24:00,678 --> 00:24:02,043
three.

391
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,637
( grunting )

392
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:08,649
Hey! Hey!

393
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:10,153
Max! Max!

394
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:12,213
Oh!

395
00:24:12,256 --> 00:24:14,121
Jesus Christ.

396
00:24:15,993 --> 00:24:18,461
( mutters )
Bud.

397
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:20,964
What-- what are you doing here?

398
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:23,296
- You came back, huh?
- You scared the hell out of me.

399
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:26,098
l want to go.
l just want to go.

400
00:24:32,476 --> 00:24:34,876
- You believe that shit, man?
- No.

401
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:36,402
Can't take a piss
in this fucking town

402
00:24:37,348 --> 00:24:38,315
without having your
fucking life threatened.

403
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:39,976
Fuck it, man. That's it.

404
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:42,212
l'm just gonna, you know, just

405
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:44,653
cut to the chase.
l'm gonna tell the story crystal clear

406
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:46,884
so even the dumbest fucker
on earth can understand it.

407
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:49,620
All right, so,
let's start with my childhood.

408
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,685
Or what l remember of it.

409
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:54,823
Martin Luther King,
Vietnam, Watergate,

410
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:57,096
that's what my childhood was.

411
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,965
Murder and men on the moon.

412
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:01,733
And then as a teenager
l was paralyzed.

413
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:03,933
l was addicted to television.

414
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:06,102
Listen to this.
l wanted to be a writer...

415
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:09,674
but l didn't want to write.

416
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:12,807
l wanted someone else
to write it--

417
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,579
write it down for me
and then give it to me,

418
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:17,087
polished and finished,
you know what l mean?

419
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:18,713
That's why l hooked up with Billy.

420
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,519
You know,
Jesus, l mean, he's the one

421
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:22,992
who did all that beautiful work.
He did all the beautiful drawings.

422
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:25,587
- My words were just filler.
- Oh no. ''Blood Sugar.''

423
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,188
That was my favorite one.

424
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:30,359
His work was never as good
after he dumped you.

425
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:34,164
- Dumped me?
- You know what l mean.

426
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:36,571
l'm sorry, man.
Wrong choice of--

427
00:25:36,607 --> 00:25:38,472
Forget it, forget it.
You know what? You're right.

428
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,876
And he was right to dump me.

429
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:43,847
- l was holding him back.
- No way.

430
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,610
l learned to take comfort

431
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,050
in the routine.

432
00:25:48,085 --> 00:25:50,144
l figured if you didn't rock the boat,

433
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:52,382
you could just sail forever.

434
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:55,517
But slowly, year after year,
my boat slowly sank

435
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,084
until l became
the stupid, fucking moron

436
00:25:58,129 --> 00:25:59,721
you see before you right now.

437
00:26:00,965 --> 00:26:03,399
And then, bit by bit,

438
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,402
l became unable
to make even the--

439
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:09,236
the smallest decision.
Paralysis by analysis.

440
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:12,106
( laughs )
Fuck me, man.

441
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:15,407
Paralysis by analysis.
Do you understand it now, Buddy?

442
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:16,970
You getting
an understanding of it?

443
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:18,709
- Actually, l only film, Max.
- Yeah?

444
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:20,740
Yeah, but l think you're wrong.

445
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:23,982
lt's 7:00 a.m.

446
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:26,148
and we're on the bus!

447
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,054
Boarding the bus!

448
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:32,153
And what do l see?

449
00:26:34,665 --> 00:26:36,428
What do l see, Buddy?

450
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:41,171
- l don't know.
- l see people just as exhausted as me.

451
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,737
People just as exhausted as me.

452
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:46,504
But sometimes,

453
00:26:46,544 --> 00:26:48,205
l get up and give my seat

454
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:51,840
to a nice older woman, okay?

455
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:53,406
And l can tell--
l can tell

456
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:56,147
that she's nice. lt's something,
somehow, l can tell.

457
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:59,782
lt's-- it's somehow in the eyes.
lt says ''nice''!

458
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:02,122
You know?
But if she's not nice--

459
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,753
fuck her! l hold my ground.

460
00:27:05,863 --> 00:27:07,455
l mean, why should
l treat an older bitch

461
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:10,433
any different than l would
treat a younger bitch, right?

462
00:27:10,468 --> 00:27:11,958
But, anon!

463
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:14,437
We have arrived--
the sprawling metropolis.

464
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:16,531
lt's the working world.
And what is there?

465
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,634
l proofread

466
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:23,044
FedExed scribblings
of the supposed geniuses.

467
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,811
Oh, man. Fuck.
The world is fucked up, man.

468
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:28,614
And this is the proof.

469
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:32,383
A good writer is by definition
a good wordsmith.

470
00:27:32,423 --> 00:27:35,881
He's-- he's the equivalent
of a shipbuilder, right?

471
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,959
Talented, yes,
of course, but a thinker?

472
00:27:39,997 --> 00:27:42,830
Fuck no!
Fuck no.

473
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:45,233
A thinker is like
a great captain, right?

474
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:46,861
But now
the wordsmith has somehow

475
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:48,565
become a motherfucking prophet.

476
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:50,437
lt's like calling a fucking--

477
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:52,339
the-- the savant,
the genius!

478
00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:53,900
Fuck that!
And fuck 'em all!

479
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:56,310
But day after day,
week after week,

480
00:27:56,347 --> 00:27:59,145
month after month,
l have to read this shit!

481
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:02,152
- ( sirens wailing )
- l have been conditioned

482
00:28:02,186 --> 00:28:05,087
to accept it and keep
my motherfucking mouth shut.

483
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,885
Because that's the way
the world works.

484
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:08,755
That's the way
the system works.

485
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:11,125
Okay?
''Homostis stememis''--

486
00:28:11,162 --> 00:28:12,891
motherfucker.

487
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:16,865
You know this word l'm thinking of?
''Homostemisisis.''

488
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:19,563
''Homostaseous.''
Fuck it, l don't know. l forgot.

489
00:28:19,603 --> 00:28:21,230
l have no idea
what you're talking about.

490
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,607
And then it's 1 2:00
and you run to the cafeteria.

491
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:28,874
But what for?
To chow down on garbage.

492
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:34,012
lt's food good enough
for moron zombies.

493
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,982
lt's good enough
for the beast.

494
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:41,321
Salt, sugar and fat.

495
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:46,127
Fuel to nourish the beast.
No matter how much you eat,

496
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:48,290
you can't fill the void,
but it's good shit, man.

497
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:51,859
lt's good shit
to nourish the beast.

498
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,529
But then, Buddy,

499
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:56,472
they start to disintegrate you.

500
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:58,702
You grow old.
Look at me.

501
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:03,237
l'm getting old, huh?

502
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,147
But then it's 4:30!

503
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:09,485
But can't leave work until 5:00.
But l struggle

504
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,512
through the next half-hour.
And then it's 5:00

505
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:16,151
and l leave the office.

506
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:19,162
l get on the same bus

507
00:29:19,196 --> 00:29:21,426
and l meet the same people
with the same looks on their faces.

508
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:24,161
But now they stink, too.

509
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:26,499
And then you go home.

510
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:31,231
Hi. Then, oh, you collapse
in the chair.

511
00:29:33,377 --> 00:29:35,436
l start to drink.

512
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,447
Eventually, you don't make love
to your wife anymore.

513
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:41,948
You feel wasted.
Your thoughts are just--

514
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:43,647
your thoughts are so disconnected.

515
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:46,986
Your mind is just full of hidden
thoughts, images, flashes.

516
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:48,514
You know?

517
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:53,287
Thoughts you can't follow
or swallow.

518
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:58,426
l-- l criticize
everyone else, you know?

519
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:00,300
l do.
But l'm the asshole.

520
00:30:01,405 --> 00:30:03,236
l'm a fucking stupid asshole.

521
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:05,435
Right? l'm the insane bastard.

522
00:30:07,344 --> 00:30:10,142
lf you want to keep sadness away,
what better remedy than death?

523
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:13,650
But l'm the stupid--
the stupid asshole.

524
00:30:13,684 --> 00:30:15,549
l'm the fucking--

525
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:18,578
( grunts )
l'm a stupid, insane bastard.

526
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:20,556
l'm a goddamn fool!

527
00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:25,828
Never understood nothing!
l never learned anything or nothing!

528
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,799
Nothing. Everything was--
everything...

529
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,136
was, um...

530
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,797
broken.

531
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:37,906
- Everything was wasted.
- Max! Max!

532
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:40,410
Can we-- can we stop this?
This is crazy.

533
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,808
What are you doing, Buddy?

534
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:45,678
Are you filming me?
Jesus, keep filming.

535
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:47,479
Are you an idiot?

536
00:30:47,518 --> 00:30:50,646
- God damn it, you coward, l'm fine.
- Hey, you guys making a movie?

537
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:52,519
- What?
- You making a movie?

538
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:54,319
Yeah. Something like that.

539
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:56,986
Well, what kind of movie?

540
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:58,585
lt's a student film.

541
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:00,324
( laughs )

542
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:02,798
ls this your star?

543
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,357
Yeah, l guess so.

544
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:07,636
What's your name?

545
00:31:09,106 --> 00:31:11,666
( chuckles )
Your name's fuck you?

546
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:14,906
Come on, look, fellas, look.
lf you gonna be setting up shop

547
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:16,435
on my turf,

548
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,311
the least you can do
is answer me.

549
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:22,314
l'm talking to you, soldier!

550
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:24,446
- Okay, let's go.
- You're kidding me, aren't ya?

551
00:31:24,488 --> 00:31:26,012
You're kidding me, right?

552
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:28,251
- You're kidding me.
- Let's go, Max.

553
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:30,522
You look like a man
who's flirted with death.

554
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,459
Am l right?

555
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:37,092
l've cheated
death so many times,

556
00:31:37,134 --> 00:31:39,659
God, l wonder if l'm ever gonna die.

557
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:41,671
But you,

558
00:31:41,705 --> 00:31:44,299
oh yeah, you're
dancing with death, aren't you?

559
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:47,500
Look, why don't you
do us both a favor

560
00:31:47,544 --> 00:31:50,377
and go on dancing or bother
or fuck with somebody else?

561
00:31:50,414 --> 00:31:52,473
- ( laughing )
- Please? Thank you. Okay?

562
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:54,575
Would-- would you
like to be immortal?

563
00:31:54,618 --> 00:31:56,586
- ( sighs )
- Huh?

564
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,520
l'll bet you
if there was a contract

565
00:31:58,555 --> 00:32:01,149
that you could sign right now

566
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:03,216
to live forever,

567
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:06,354
you'd put your name on it right now,
wouldn't you?

568
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:10,760
But there isn't, is there?

569
00:32:11,869 --> 00:32:13,837
Anyway...

570
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:16,663
you're a solider, aren't you?

571
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:20,609
You're a solider.

572
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:22,509
- Yeah, it's in your eyes.
- Really?

573
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:24,446
Yeah yeah, l can--

574
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:28,144
l can still see it
when the desert explodes,

575
00:32:28,185 --> 00:32:31,279
the sand mixed with the blood,

576
00:32:31,322 --> 00:32:33,449
mixed with the burning oil

577
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,584
and all of the soldiers
glow like embers.

578
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:39,562
And then they're gone.
And the last thing that they see

579
00:32:39,596 --> 00:32:42,531
are the palm trees
burning like candles.

580
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:45,034
No one to turn to,
no one to help,

581
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:47,037
no one to save them.

582
00:32:48,305 --> 00:32:50,466
Because the end, brother...

583
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:53,874
- it's the ultimate outcome.
- You mean the ultimate horror.

584
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:55,606
Your word choice is awful.

585
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:58,080
- The ultimate horror, right?
- ls it? ls it the ultimate horror?

586
00:32:58,115 --> 00:32:59,639
ls it?

587
00:32:59,683 --> 00:33:03,016
Or is it the ultimate truth?

588
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:06,679
Hmm?

589
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:10,660
A man who has a gun
will eventually use it.

590
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:14,488
You have a gun on you, don't you?

591
00:33:14,531 --> 00:33:16,999
( laughs )
Don't you?

592
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,558
Mm-hmm, oh yeah, yeah.

593
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:21,196
l can-- l can smell it.

594
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:23,035
- He doesn't.
- Hmm?

595
00:33:23,073 --> 00:33:25,132
- He has a gun on him, don't he?
- Yeah.

596
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:27,302
- He has a gun on him!
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

597
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:28,902
Put the fucking gun down, Max.

598
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,841
Oh, see? See that?

599
00:33:31,882 --> 00:33:34,373
See how exciting that is?

600
00:33:34,418 --> 00:33:36,648
- Huh?
- Fuck yourself.

601
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:39,019
How many rounds
you got in there?

602
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:41,217
- l got two. One for you and one for me.
- Don't--

603
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:44,386
lf you don't walk away right now,
l'm gonna fucking kill you

604
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:46,555
and your days
of cheating death will be over.

605
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:48,189
God damn it, get out of here.

606
00:33:48,232 --> 00:33:50,257
( laughing )
Okay, soldier.

607
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,565
Just listen, soldier, listen.
Look, we're all just playing here.

608
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:55,629
- Oh, we're just playing?
- We're just playing.

609
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:57,663
Oh, is that what this is?

610
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:02,306
You and l are casualties of the war.

611
00:34:03,514 --> 00:34:05,709
The war will never end.

612
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:07,444
Veteran:
We're ghosts.

613
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:11,221
Ghosts.

614
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,986
All of us.

615
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:17,857
Go ahead, put it right there.
Put it right there.

616
00:34:17,895 --> 00:34:19,385
- Bud: Let's go.
- Go on, get away.

617
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,057
Put it right there.

618
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,293
- Go ahead, put that gun right there.
- Sir, can you please--

619
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,301
That's all right, forget it.

620
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:31,137
Game over.

621
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:32,870
- Yeah.
- You win.

622
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:37,308
Fuck off.
Go fuck yourself.

623
00:34:37,347 --> 00:34:39,042
- lt's game over.
- You win.

624
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:41,550
You win.
Fuck yourself.

625
00:34:41,585 --> 00:34:45,248
A man with a gun will eventually use it.
( laughing )

626
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,024
Go fuck yourself, you bastard.

627
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:56,830
A man with a gun
will eventually use it.

628
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,596
Max:
l said go fuck yourself!

629
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:00,193
( laughing )

630
00:35:21,825 --> 00:35:25,556
That was the last
bus ride of my life.

631
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,730
And l can't say
l'm gonna miss it.

632
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,926
Anyway, you ever noticed the people
that are waiting at a bus stop?

633
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,302
They have a look of--
pardon me, pardon me,

634
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,103
you rude people.
l was talking.

635
00:35:38,141 --> 00:35:41,042
You notice that people at a bus stop?
They have a look of quiet desperation.

636
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:43,478
lt is the definition
of quiet desperation, l'd say.

637
00:35:43,514 --> 00:35:45,414
And then sometimes
a black limousine will roll by,

638
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,508
you can see them thinking,

639
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:49,314
''That could've been me.

640
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:51,480
Only-- if only.''

641
00:35:51,522 --> 00:35:53,387
Pretty good, huh?

642
00:35:53,423 --> 00:35:55,254
So what do you think?

643
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,119
This-- what do you think?

644
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:00,823
This could be a way. Huh?

645
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:04,829
You read about it every day.
People throw themselves on the tracks.

646
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:07,894
Huh, Bud?
100,000 volts.

647
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:11,635
And if you don't die from the shock,
the train slices you into 10 pieces.

648
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:13,870
So what do you say?
Should l jump, Bud?

649
00:36:13,911 --> 00:36:15,401
- Huh?
- No.

650
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:17,242
- No?
- No, Max.

651
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:20,011
What's wrong with it?
Not original enough, huh?

652
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,416
You're right. There's a thousand
great ways to die.

653
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:28,687
- What?
- There are no great ways to die.

654
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:31,819
- Oh, please, leave me alone.
- ( train horn blaring )

655
00:36:31,862 --> 00:36:33,454
l'm a free man.

656
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,556
l'll die the-- l'll die
the way l want to, okay?

657
00:36:48,879 --> 00:36:52,178
Hey, Bud, if anyone's
supposed to die today,

658
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:53,842
it's gonna be me.
Okay? Come on.

659
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:56,079
Okay? Come on.
This is scary.

660
00:37:02,326 --> 00:37:05,727
Buddy, let's go, huh?
You all right?

661
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:09,528
- lt's hot in here.
- ( train clacking )

662
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:11,193
Whoa.

663
00:37:12,235 --> 00:37:14,362
l hate subways.

664
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,168
Look at them.
Look at them.

665
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:21,234
Max:
All the same faces--

666
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:24,008
blank and desperate,
just like mine was until today.

667
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:27,482
Hey, what do you think
they care about, huh?

668
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:29,951
- What do they care about?
- l don't know.

669
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:31,818
Shit, man.

670
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:34,085
Contributions.

671
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:37,683
Premiums.

672
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:41,095
Taxes.
Life insurance, car insurance.

673
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:47,198
And rape insurance.

674
00:37:48,238 --> 00:37:50,103
Why not? Looks like this chick
could use some, huh?

675
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,166
Now dig this.

676
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,701
Women can get--
can claim damages

677
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:57,509
from being raped.
How about that?

678
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:59,344
''l was raped
by three homies, baby.''

679
00:37:59,383 --> 00:38:00,873
''Don't worry, honey.
You'll get your dough.''

680
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,942
A real money-maker--
rape insurance, l think.

681
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:05,113
''Don't worry, you're beautiful.
You're gonna get paid.''

682
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:08,052
( laughing )

683
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:10,116
Then again,
if you're fat or ugly

684
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,923
or both,

685
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:14,362
you'll get an even better deal.

686
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:15,888
America, right?

687
00:38:15,932 --> 00:38:17,900
Pay less, get more.

688
00:38:17,934 --> 00:38:19,424
Welcome

689
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,061
to mankind.
Welcome to the human race.

690
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:23,402
- Bud, don't you agree?
- You're full of shit.

691
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,101
That's one thing l'm not.

692
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:26,905
l'm not full of shit, Bud, at all.

693
00:38:27,944 --> 00:38:31,243
My thinking is crystalline,
pristine clear.

694
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:33,749
People disgust me.
They're disgusting.

695
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:36,116
l'm leaving the world
with a joyful heart, an open mind

696
00:38:36,153 --> 00:38:37,745
and a joyful mind.

697
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:40,484
l'm gonna get the fuck
out of here, okay?

698
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:43,254
So, shall we? Come on,
we have an appointment with death.

699
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:45,591
- Let's go.
- ( doors open )

700
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:50,730
Last subway ride.

701
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:58,639
Fuck.
Today is freedom day.

702
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,973
My freedom day.

703
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:03,172
l'll end all this shit
and here l am impeded in my works

704
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:04,908
by a fucking cripple.

705
00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:07,807
- Deaf too! Hey!
- Shut up.

706
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:14,118
- Hey!
- What?

707
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:16,352
Why you gotta be so aggressive?

708
00:39:16,393 --> 00:39:17,917
- Come on.
- What did they do to you?

709
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:20,619
Huh?!

710
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:23,997
You know what? l think it's more
of what they haven't done.

711
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:26,594
What, am l supposed to love them?
All of them?

712
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:28,365
Do you think they love me?

713
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:29,929
Have they been nice to me?

714
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:32,271
No, they haven't been.
Never have been and never will be.

715
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,971
Man is not nice!

716
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:36,603
People are not nice!

717
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,571
- Okay?
- ( loud crash )

718
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:41,345
Come on.

719
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:44,684
( car alarm blaring )

720
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:46,655
Oh, God.

721
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:50,924
Hey hey hey.
Stay there.

722
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:57,428
Max:
lt's okay.

723
00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:03,771
- Oh, shit.
- All right. lt's okay.

724
00:40:06,476 --> 00:40:08,671
lt's gonna be fine.

725
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:10,509
- ( sirens blaring )
- l know.

726
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:13,276
l know everything's
gonna be okay.

727
00:40:13,316 --> 00:40:15,910
- Woman: Thank you.
- Okay?

728
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,783
Thank you.
( crying )

729
00:40:23,527 --> 00:40:26,325
Okay. l'm sorry.

730
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:28,354
Bud! Bud, we gotta go!

731
00:40:29,966 --> 00:40:31,797
- Okay.
- We've got to go. Let's go, come on!

732
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:34,530
Let's go!

733
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:43,674
A new man is born!

734
00:40:43,713 --> 00:40:45,476
- Oh! That was something, huh?
- That was amazing.

735
00:40:45,515 --> 00:40:47,278
Whoo-hoo!
That was something.

736
00:40:47,317 --> 00:40:48,909
l feel alive. Finally.

737
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:53,455
l finally feel alive.
At last.

738
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,186
And you know,
when you're alive,

739
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:58,285
nice becomes possible.

740
00:40:58,328 --> 00:40:59,852
- You can be nice.
- Huh?

741
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:02,194
You can be nice,
l've seen it.

742
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:04,257
- On occasion.
- Oh, please.

743
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:06,360
l'm always-- always
been a bit of a bastard.

744
00:41:07,404 --> 00:41:09,304
Although, l do feel reborn.

745
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:11,307
But you know what, Buddy?
l don't think you understand

746
00:41:11,341 --> 00:41:13,536
- what l'm trying to get at really.
- What do you mean?

747
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:15,704
That was one of the bravest
things l have ever seen, Max.

748
00:41:15,745 --> 00:41:17,372
You are a great guy.

749
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,882
Yeah, but am l a nice guy?

750
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,713
See, l just did what l had to do.

751
00:41:21,751 --> 00:41:23,309
Anyone would have
done the same.

752
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:24,843
- Right?
- No.

753
00:41:24,888 --> 00:41:27,220
But nice-- no, hang on--
nice is something totally different.

754
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:29,054
You know what?
l'm gonna prove it to you right now.

755
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:30,821
Right now,
l'm gonna show you.

756
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:34,126
Excuse me, sir.
Flowers.

757
00:41:34,164 --> 00:41:35,893
Right here, those.

758
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:37,900
Here you go.
Keep the change.

759
00:41:40,337 --> 00:41:43,306
These.
Okay. Take them.

760
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,898
They're for you.

761
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:46,738
Just for you.

762
00:41:46,776 --> 00:41:49,677
l thank you for recording

763
00:41:49,713 --> 00:41:52,841
this digital odyssey.

764
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:55,681
Only for you.
Love me. Marry me.

765
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,018
No, thank you.

766
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:01,421
You're afraid l won't be
nice to you, huh?

767
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,722
You're afraid l won't be nice to you.
Fuck you.

768
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:07,125
Excuse me, young lady, please.

769
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,154
These are for you,
only for you.

770
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:10,962
Take them, please.
You-- you don't want it?

771
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,969
Well, it's not like they're
gonna explode in your face.

772
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:15,335
l'm just trying to be nice to you!
l was just trying to be nice to her!

773
00:42:15,372 --> 00:42:17,203
- Buddy! Where are you?
- Bud: Yeah?

774
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,199
You see how it is?
Even kindness is scary.

775
00:42:21,244 --> 00:42:22,871
l'll be a son of a bitch.

776
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:24,881
l just want to be nice, just--

777
00:42:27,317 --> 00:42:30,286
Excuse me. Ma'am.

778
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,015
Please.

779
00:42:32,055 --> 00:42:34,455
Take this lovely bouquet
that l bought just for you.

780
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:38,291
And let me-- let me,
please let me do this. Please.

781
00:42:38,328 --> 00:42:40,353
- Take them from me.
- ( laughs ) Thank you.

782
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:48,630
Well, what do you know?

783
00:42:51,508 --> 00:42:53,305
Hey, maybe you're right.

784
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:55,470
- Huh?
- There! See? l am nice, you're right.

785
00:42:55,512 --> 00:42:57,309
l'm nice! l'm a nice guy.
l'm super nice.

786
00:42:57,347 --> 00:42:59,406
l'm Max the nice!

787
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:02,384
Although, to be fair,

788
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:04,148
with an older woman,
it's entirely different.

789
00:43:04,187 --> 00:43:06,212
She doesn't automatically
assume you want to fuck her.

790
00:43:06,256 --> 00:43:09,885
lt's like a light
at the end of a dark hallway.

791
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:14,556
Older women
believe that the gesture

792
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:17,657
just might in fact be genuine.

793
00:43:18,868 --> 00:43:20,927
Bud, you ever been
with an older woman?

794
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:22,461
- Bud, l'm talking to you!
- No.

795
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:25,099
No, well, unless
25 counts as older.

796
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:27,609
25? Fuck you, 25.
( laughs )

797
00:43:28,878 --> 00:43:30,402
You know what, Buddy,
Mr. Buddy?

798
00:43:30,447 --> 00:43:33,177
l'm gonna make a prediction.
l'm gonna predict something.

799
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:35,184
l predict that today

800
00:43:35,218 --> 00:43:37,516
you will grow up and be a man.

801
00:43:37,554 --> 00:43:40,022
And you will leave
childish things behind you. Okay?

802
00:43:40,056 --> 00:43:41,648
- That's my prediction.
- Well,

803
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:43,522
the only thing l'm gonna
leave behind is you, Max.

804
00:43:44,828 --> 00:43:46,489
Unless you've changed
your mind about today?

805
00:43:48,298 --> 00:43:49,890
Hey, Bud...

806
00:43:51,568 --> 00:43:53,195
l was gonna say--

807
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:55,864
listen to me.

808
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:58,032
l was gonna tell you
you were a nice kid.

809
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:00,542
But you're not.

810
00:44:00,577 --> 00:44:02,568
You're a sweet man.

811
00:44:04,647 --> 00:44:08,242
You're my--
you're my only true friend.

812
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:10,877
You're my only friend.

813
00:44:15,191 --> 00:44:16,715
- Hey.
- What?

814
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,194
Why don't we take a break?

815
00:44:19,229 --> 00:44:21,390
l'm getting kind of tired.

816
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:23,092
Okay, sure sure sure.

817
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,530
So, how we doing?

818
00:44:28,571 --> 00:44:31,335
- What do you mean?
- Do you like what we got so far?

819
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:35,035
- ( laughs ) Like it?
- Yeah.

820
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:37,376
Can't say l like it.

821
00:44:37,414 --> 00:44:39,041
But it's something.

822
00:44:40,183 --> 00:44:41,844
lt's definitely something.

823
00:44:41,885 --> 00:44:44,149
l'll take something.
Something's better than nothing.

824
00:44:51,928 --> 00:44:53,589
( voice cracking )
Look at this city.

825
00:44:55,899 --> 00:44:58,197
Look at these buildings.

826
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,096
So much beauty, huh?

827
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:04,370
Yeah.

828
00:45:05,975 --> 00:45:09,411
Concern your life with--
with beauty.

829
00:45:10,447 --> 00:45:12,506
Focus on beauty and--
and you'll be happy.

830
00:45:12,549 --> 00:45:14,278
You'll be a happy man.
You want to be happy?

831
00:45:15,652 --> 00:45:17,882
- Who doesn't?
- Okay.

832
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:19,889
Then you gotta be true--

833
00:45:19,923 --> 00:45:21,891
you gotta be true to your heart then.

834
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,619
But it's--
it's a very hard thing to do.

835
00:45:25,662 --> 00:45:27,459
lt's a very hard thing to do, man.

836
00:45:27,497 --> 00:45:29,522
Bud. lt's hard.

837
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:32,626
There's so much fucking noise.

838
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,535
- l know.
- Paralyzing noise.

839
00:45:35,572 --> 00:45:37,369
- Soul-destroying noise.
- l know.

840
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,308
There's so much noise.

841
00:45:43,346 --> 00:45:45,780
Just focus on the beauty,
okay, kid?

842
00:45:45,815 --> 00:45:47,908
- l will.
- Okay.

843
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:49,543
Let's go.

844
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:55,286
l think women can
kind of tell things about a man.

845
00:45:55,325 --> 00:45:57,725
For instance, myself, if you
look in my eyes, what do you see?

846
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,523
- Loser.
- ( pop music playing )

847
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:01,359
Defeated, and they know.

848
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:03,729
You know?
lt's like they have a sixth sense.

849
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,365
To be perfectly honest,

850
00:46:09,405 --> 00:46:10,997
last couple of years,

851
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,632
l've been reduced
to paying for it.

852
00:46:12,675 --> 00:46:15,041
l thought that would be simpler.
And as usual...

853
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:18,137
l was wrong.

854
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:24,878
Psst.

855
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:28,014
What?

856
00:46:28,057 --> 00:46:29,854
The waitress.
She's pretty hot, huh?

857
00:46:31,494 --> 00:46:32,927
She's all right.

858
00:46:32,962 --> 00:46:35,226
You want me
to set you up with her?

859
00:46:35,265 --> 00:46:37,028
- Leave her alone.
- What'd you say?

860
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:39,967
- Leave her alone.
- Fuck you, leaver her alone.

861
00:46:40,003 --> 00:46:41,561
Are you fucking kidding me, Max?

862
00:46:41,604 --> 00:46:43,629
Hey, look, dude. You got me
confused with somebody else.

863
00:46:43,673 --> 00:46:45,937
Probably yourself.
l am me.

864
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:47,704
- Okay?
- Really?

865
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:50,144
- Yeah yeah.
- How will you do it?

866
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,047
Watch. Hey, look.
l've still got some skills, baby.

867
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:55,050
l got some moves left.

868
00:46:55,084 --> 00:46:56,608
Watch this.

869
00:46:56,653 --> 00:46:59,053
- No, you're not.
- Oh, yes l am.

870
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:02,057
- Watch and learn.
- Max!

871
00:47:05,028 --> 00:47:06,586
- All right.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

872
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:08,153
- How are you?
- Good.

873
00:47:08,198 --> 00:47:11,099
- My name is...
- ( laughing )

874
00:47:22,412 --> 00:47:26,143
Um, l think that means no.
Does that mean no?

875
00:47:26,182 --> 00:47:28,116
That means no.
Fuck it. Let's go.

876
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:30,051
- That went well.
- l know.

877
00:47:30,086 --> 00:47:33,578
- Brad Pitt. Not even funny, huh?
- Thanks, l learned a lot.

878
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:35,181
Max:
Hey!

879
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:39,786
( siren wailing )

880
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:41,694
Hey, being hit by
a speeding ambulance.

881
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:45,024
Now that's an idea.

882
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:47,298
Of course, some idiot like me
might end up saving me.

883
00:47:47,337 --> 00:47:49,498
( laughs )
Maybe that is a better idea

884
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:51,666
than blowing my brains out.

885
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:54,404
What do you think? Oh!

886
00:47:54,444 --> 00:47:56,605
l remember years ago
hearing a story about this guy.

887
00:47:56,646 --> 00:48:00,605
Hang on. Somewhere in New Jersey,
New Hampshire, new something--

888
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,175
anyway, he had a heart attack, right?

889
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:06,211
And it was snowing,
freezing rain.

890
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:08,656
Right? And the ambulance
that was coming to save him,

891
00:48:08,691 --> 00:48:11,854
it skidded on the ice
and ran him over and killed him.

892
00:48:11,894 --> 00:48:13,862
( laughing )

893
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:15,454
That'd be a good one, right?

894
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,329
Hard to set up though, huh?

895
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:21,564
- Yeah.
- ( church bell tolling )

896
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:25,137
A monument to God.

897
00:48:25,174 --> 00:48:27,165
Quite something, huh?
Hey, you know what?

898
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,178
l'd like a monument too.

899
00:48:29,212 --> 00:48:30,702
Something for people
to remember me by.

900
00:48:30,747 --> 00:48:32,544
And maybe you'll
build me one, Buddy.

901
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:35,676
Huh? l am the way,
the faith, the life.

902
00:48:35,718 --> 00:48:37,879
How grand.
How fucking pompous, huh?

903
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,854
You know what?
We never talk about faith.

904
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:42,653
We haven't. l still don't know
if you believe in God or not.

905
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:44,182
Do you?

906
00:48:44,227 --> 00:48:47,754
Don't be shy.
Today is not the day for shy.

907
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:52,259
- So what is it?
- Yes, l do.

908
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:54,532
- l do believe in God.
- Good!

909
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,162
lt's good to believe in something.

910
00:48:56,205 --> 00:48:58,230
Even if it's fucking bullshit!

911
00:49:00,977 --> 00:49:02,501
Priests.

912
00:49:02,545 --> 00:49:04,342
( chuckles )
Priests.

913
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,405
Little, sad men.
l bet they're sad men.

914
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,007
Or at least they will be.

915
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:11,384
lmagine devoting your entire life
to a God that could be purely imaginary,

916
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:13,412
illusory, not there.

917
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:15,515
What a fucking waste.
l feel sorry for them.

918
00:49:15,558 --> 00:49:17,753
l feel sorry for all believers.

919
00:49:17,794 --> 00:49:20,661
Bunch of mentally
crippled children.

920
00:49:20,697 --> 00:49:22,426
Our Father who art in Heaven,

921
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:25,093
hallowed be some dough.
l need some more money.

922
00:49:25,134 --> 00:49:26,658
- Shut up.
- l need some dough, God!

923
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:28,193
- Shut up.
- What?

924
00:49:28,237 --> 00:49:29,898
Just shut up!

925
00:49:33,643 --> 00:49:35,201
Don't put the fucking camera down!

926
00:49:35,244 --> 00:49:37,041
Don't put that camera down!

927
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,638
This is my day, remember?

928
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:41,445
And if l want to mock your
imaginary God, you cut me some slack.

929
00:49:41,484 --> 00:49:44,749
l figure l deserve it.
And by the way, Buddy,

930
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:46,550
where is your God

931
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:48,489
- when you really need him?
- Okay, you know, Max,

932
00:49:48,524 --> 00:49:50,685
this whole broken-hearted
nihilist angle...

933
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:52,217
- Yeah?
- lt's getting old.

934
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:54,422
Hang on.
Say that again.

935
00:49:54,464 --> 00:49:56,056
- Fuck off!
- What?

936
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,896
- Say it again!
- Fuck off!

937
00:49:57,934 --> 00:49:59,834
Huh?

938
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:02,429
The way l see it,
God's like success.

939
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:04,599
You're shitting me.
God's like success?

940
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,734
Listen!
Listen to me for once!

941
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:11,905
- What?
- lt's all around us.

942
00:50:11,948 --> 00:50:14,610
Just 'cause you
can't have it or see it...

943
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,246
does not mean it does not exist.

944
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:21,813
So much venom
for someone so young.

945
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:23,917
lt's a shame you weren't
around for the Crusades.

946
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,520
You could have butchered young children
and chopped their heads off.

947
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:30,565
And l hope you still believe
in this God when you're my age.

948
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,431
And if you don't want
to do this anymore, fine!

949
00:50:32,468 --> 00:50:33,992
Forget it.

950
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:38,674
( church bell tolling )

951
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:49,075
Time to set a few things straight.

952
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,980
Where are we going?

953
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:55,721
l'm going to visit my boss.

954
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:58,727
Okay? Cocktails before dinner,
just him and me.

955
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:01,853
This really necessary?

956
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:04,128
Well, the way l figure it,

957
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:06,362
more than any other
person l've known,

958
00:51:06,402 --> 00:51:08,700
this bastard ruined my life.

959
00:51:10,006 --> 00:51:11,667
Why didn't you just quit, Max?

960
00:51:11,707 --> 00:51:13,538
Let him win? Never.

961
00:51:13,576 --> 00:51:15,669
Besides, Bud,
l needed that job, you know?

962
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:20,382
Could never get away from him.
Even had dreams about him.

963
00:51:20,416 --> 00:51:24,045
Eight hours a day became 24.

964
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:27,055
Even on Sundays,
his face haunted me.

965
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:30,525
Then on Monday l would go to work
absolutely fucking exhausted.

966
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,460
And...

967
00:51:32,495 --> 00:51:34,725
wait to be humiliated.

968
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:36,527
Sometimes brutal,
sometimes clever and subtle,

969
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:39,592
but not a day has passed

970
00:51:39,635 --> 00:51:42,331
in the last 10 years
when he didn't--

971
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:43,963
he didn't put me down.

972
00:51:45,107 --> 00:51:46,904
Not just to my face,

973
00:51:46,943 --> 00:51:49,036
but in front of everyone
in the office.

974
00:51:52,748 --> 00:51:55,046
But today, it'll be different.

975
00:51:56,085 --> 00:51:57,677
lt'll all be different.

976
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:01,523
- Hey, did you get that?
- Yeah.

977
00:52:01,557 --> 00:52:03,855
l got it all.

978
00:52:03,893 --> 00:52:06,020
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

979
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:08,428
Okay, um, just wait outside,
okay, kid?

980
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:11,694
Why? Why?

981
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:13,565
Please, Bud, come on.
Just wait outside.

982
00:52:13,603 --> 00:52:15,093
Look...

983
00:52:15,137 --> 00:52:17,628
this is between
him and me, all right?

984
00:52:21,344 --> 00:52:23,369
- Max.
- Huh?

985
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:27,413
lt's gonna be okay, Buddy.
lt'll be okay. l'll be right back.

986
00:52:40,696 --> 00:52:42,493
( doorbell buzzing )

987
00:52:49,205 --> 00:52:51,537
Come on, let's go.

988
00:52:51,574 --> 00:52:53,804
- What are you doing?
- Get down! l said sit down!

989
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:55,777
- Take it easy! Jesus Christ, man.
- Sit down! Sit down!

990
00:52:55,811 --> 00:52:57,836
Put that-- put that away!
Don't point that at me!

991
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,677
- Just sit down!
- l'm sitting! Fuck!

992
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,818
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Maybe l am.

993
00:53:02,852 --> 00:53:04,911
- You got a fucking gun!
- Uh-huh.

994
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:06,785
Just-- just do me a favor,
put that away.

995
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:08,722
l'll forget you ever were here,
all right? Put it away.

996
00:53:08,758 --> 00:53:10,521
No.

997
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:13,788
Fuck, l haven't see you all week.
You suddenly come into my house.

998
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:15,592
- l thought you quit.
- What?

999
00:53:15,631 --> 00:53:17,223
Oh, l bet you did.

1000
00:53:18,234 --> 00:53:20,828
You're not getting rid of me
that easy, okay?

1001
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:22,963
No, l came here to get
some straight answers from you,

1002
00:53:23,005 --> 00:53:24,700
you dirty bastard.

1003
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,605
From-- from-- what-- what--

1004
00:53:26,642 --> 00:53:28,735
what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me?

1005
00:53:30,413 --> 00:53:32,506
- Max.
- Huh?

1006
00:53:32,548 --> 00:53:35,346
lf you need a raise, you know,
the gun thing is not the way to go.

1007
00:53:36,352 --> 00:53:39,583
A raise? See, that's where
you and l are different.

1008
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:41,419
- What?
- See,

1009
00:53:41,457 --> 00:53:43,857
- l want to know why.
- Why what?

1010
00:53:43,893 --> 00:53:45,417
l want to know from you,

1011
00:53:45,461 --> 00:53:47,190
l want to know why.

1012
00:53:47,229 --> 00:53:49,493
Why what?

1013
00:53:49,532 --> 00:53:51,227
Why have you been
so unkind to me?

1014
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:53,929
Why l was never given
a promotion and passed over?

1015
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,734
- Why?
- Other people are better qualified.

1016
00:53:56,772 --> 00:53:58,330
- Oh, bullshit.
- lt's the truth.

1017
00:53:58,374 --> 00:54:00,774
- Bullshit.
- Sorry, it's the truth.

1018
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:04,540
l can't believe
with a gun in your face

1019
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:06,912
- you're lying to me.
- l'm not lying.

1020
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:08,678
Now you're gonna
tell me the truth.

1021
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:10,481
- Look in my eyes.
- Yeah, l can see you're serious.

1022
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:12,009
- l get the point.
- You've got it?

1023
00:54:12,054 --> 00:54:13,578
You have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

1024
00:54:13,623 --> 00:54:15,147
Look, if l-- if l tell you the truth,

1025
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:16,783
it's not going to be
as easy to handle as a lie.

1026
00:54:16,826 --> 00:54:18,487
Just drop your bullshit
and give it to me, okay?

1027
00:54:18,527 --> 00:54:21,792
You're a really smart guy, okay?
Smartest guy in the whole office.

1028
00:54:21,831 --> 00:54:24,299
You get in your own way, okay?

1029
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,459
You want to know why?

1030
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,594
Want to know the truth why you didn't
get ahead in the company?

1031
00:54:27,637 --> 00:54:30,435
Wait.

1032
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:32,236
You're shitting me.

1033
00:54:35,978 --> 00:54:37,605
Because you didn't like me?

1034
00:54:37,647 --> 00:54:39,547
From the moment l met you.

1035
00:54:39,582 --> 00:54:41,914
l look at your face, it pisses me off.
The gun doesn't help, either.

1036
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:43,816
- l need a drink, man.
- Sure. No, wait.

1037
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:45,980
- You didn't like me?
- lt's a chemistry thing.

1038
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:49,253
lt's not your fault.
You look like you need a drink too.

1039
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,291
- Just getting a--
- ( ice cubes clanking )

1040
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,633
Here.

1041
00:54:58,668 --> 00:55:00,192
- Not me.
- You can use it.

1042
00:55:00,236 --> 00:55:02,534
No. You got any blow?

1043
00:55:02,571 --> 00:55:04,402
No, l don't have blow.

1044
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,204
l have a little, okay?
Just-- just-- if you want--

1045
00:55:07,243 --> 00:55:09,302
- A cokehead. A cokehead.
- No, l'm not.

1046
00:55:09,345 --> 00:55:12,075
- On top of everything else, a cokehead.
- On weekends.

1047
00:55:12,114 --> 00:55:13,741
( laughing )

1048
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:16,411
Max, maybe you're a nice guy
deep deep deep down inside

1049
00:55:16,452 --> 00:55:19,478
- where no one can see. Okay?
- Not even there, really.

1050
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:20,682
You know what,

1051
00:55:20,723 --> 00:55:22,850
l didn't give a fuck about you
until you pointed that gun at me.

1052
00:55:22,892 --> 00:55:25,861
That's the only true thing
you've said all day.

1053
00:55:25,895 --> 00:55:28,489
My back hurts.

1054
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:35,261
( laughs )

1055
00:55:35,304 --> 00:55:37,738
- l don't trust you.
- All right. You shouldn't.

1056
00:55:37,773 --> 00:55:39,297
l mean, would you,

1057
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:41,468
if you were in my shoes?

1058
00:55:42,712 --> 00:55:44,577
l got a boss too. Okay, Max?

1059
00:55:44,613 --> 00:55:46,740
l got a boss too.
l got people who don't like me

1060
00:55:46,782 --> 00:55:48,875
- more than they don't like you.
- Yeah, you're an asshole.

1061
00:55:48,918 --> 00:55:50,852
- Then why didn't you quit?
- l needed the money.

1062
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:52,478
That's why l didn't fire you!

1063
00:55:52,521 --> 00:55:54,386
lf you don't know
what to make of yourself,

1064
00:55:54,423 --> 00:55:55,981
don't fucking blame me, all right?

1065
00:55:56,025 --> 00:55:58,493
lt's not my fucking fault
your life is a disaster.

1066
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:01,155
Point the gun at your own
fucking head, not at me.

1067
00:56:02,398 --> 00:56:04,696
You're so fucking smug.

1068
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:06,224
l mean, look at you.

1069
00:56:06,268 --> 00:56:09,032
- What?
- Look at this-- this place.

1070
00:56:09,071 --> 00:56:11,665
l mean, you built it
on the backs of people like me.

1071
00:56:11,707 --> 00:56:13,732
What are you,
a fucking communist now?

1072
00:56:13,776 --> 00:56:15,835
Get down on your knees
and say sorry to me.

1073
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:20,711
- What?
- ( whimpering ) l-- l don't want to.

1074
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,581
- Come on, say you're sorry.
- What for? l didn't do anything.

1075
00:56:22,618 --> 00:56:24,176
- Say you're sorry.
- ( glass shattering )

1076
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,949
( gunshot )

1077
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:27,478
Fuck!

1078
00:56:27,523 --> 00:56:29,457
Max!

1079
00:56:29,492 --> 00:56:31,619
- Jesus. What happened?
- There was an accident.

1080
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,685
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Did you shoot him?

1081
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,220
- We gotta go. We have to go.
- Max!

1082
00:56:36,265 --> 00:56:38,199
No no no.
Come on!

1083
00:56:39,502 --> 00:56:42,494
( car horn blaring )

1084
00:56:42,538 --> 00:56:44,301
( dispatch radio chattering )

1085
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,901
- So, how's your night so far?
- You talking-- what? What?

1086
00:56:56,886 --> 00:56:58,854
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

1087
00:56:58,888 --> 00:57:01,152
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened?

1088
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,885
Nothing happened.

1089
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,987
( groans )

1090
00:57:07,263 --> 00:57:08,992
Tell me.

1091
00:57:09,031 --> 00:57:10,623
- Huh?
- Tell me.

1092
00:57:14,303 --> 00:57:15,793
lt was an accident.

1093
00:57:22,878 --> 00:57:24,505
- We have to call an ambulance.
- No.

1094
00:57:24,547 --> 00:57:27,277
- Sir, we have to pull over.
- Shut up! No.

1095
00:57:27,316 --> 00:57:30,217
- We have to fucking pull over.
- An ambulance isn't necessary.

1096
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:32,584
You understand?

1097
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,111
An ambulance isn't necessary.

1098
00:57:35,524 --> 00:57:37,219
Max:
lt's nothing, sir.

1099
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:40,694
He's dead?

1100
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:49,061
( panting )

1101
00:57:49,104 --> 00:57:50,765
( whimpering )

1102
00:58:12,228 --> 00:58:15,288
You should go home.
l'm sorry l--

1103
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:18,357
l'm sorry l got you mixed up
in all this-- this bullshit.

1104
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,425
Kid, just go home, okay?
Go home.

1105
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:22,027
Have you changed your mind?

1106
00:58:22,071 --> 00:58:24,266
Aw, come on.
What difference does it make, Bud?

1107
00:58:24,306 --> 00:58:26,467
l'm-- l'm dead either way.
Go home. Come on.

1108
00:58:28,677 --> 00:58:31,145
- Max.
- Huh?

1109
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,841
l'm not going anywhere.

1110
00:58:32,882 --> 00:58:35,783
Oh, come on, Bud.
l don't have-- whatever.

1111
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,249
l mean-- what?

1112
00:58:39,288 --> 00:58:40,983
What are we doing here?

1113
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:43,150
What do you mean?

1114
00:58:43,192 --> 00:58:45,524
Oh. Oh, hey, you want
to meet my ex?

1115
00:58:45,561 --> 00:58:47,756
l'm gonna go see Carla.
Remember Carla? l told--

1116
00:58:47,796 --> 00:58:49,559
- Hey, you know, um--
- She's right over there.

1117
00:58:49,598 --> 00:58:51,463
There's no point.
What's the point of this?

1118
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,730
l'm not interested
in meeting her.

1119
00:58:53,769 --> 00:58:55,669
We should go.
We should go.

1120
00:58:59,808 --> 00:59:02,003
- You gonna shoot her too?
- What?

1121
00:59:02,044 --> 00:59:03,568
You gonna shoot her too?

1122
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:07,179
Bud.

1123
00:59:07,216 --> 00:59:08,774
The only person

1124
00:59:08,817 --> 00:59:10,978
who l intended to shoot today

1125
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,681
was myself, okay?

1126
00:59:14,823 --> 00:59:17,485
Come on. lt'll be fun.
She's really mean.

1127
00:59:18,994 --> 00:59:20,791
Max: Rarely have you met
a person as mean as her.

1128
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:23,354
( Max chuckles )

1129
00:59:23,399 --> 00:59:25,799
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- l won't be in till 10:00.

1130
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:29,094
( laughs )

1131
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:32,534
lt's me again.

1132
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:34,508
Back again to brighten your day.

1133
00:59:37,646 --> 00:59:39,807
Shaken up a little bit there, Carla?

1134
00:59:42,184 --> 00:59:44,311
- What the hell you want, Max?
- What?

1135
00:59:44,353 --> 00:59:47,686
- This isn't a family reunion.
- You like my jump?

1136
00:59:47,723 --> 00:59:49,247
Yeah, l did.

1137
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,156
Nice to see you too.
How's the gallery doing?

1138
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:53,593
Fine.

1139
00:59:53,629 --> 00:59:55,927
- How's your job?
- l quit.

1140
00:59:55,965 --> 00:59:58,433
- Good for you.
- My usual.

1141
00:59:58,467 --> 01:00:00,025
Another brilliant achievement.

1142
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,632
l got a dinner engagement.

1143
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:06,934
Carla, you've never even
cared how l felt, have you?

1144
01:00:06,976 --> 01:00:08,466
You don't understand me.

1145
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,842
You don't understand what l'm
going through. You just never have.

1146
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,676
Good thing we got
divorced then, isn't it?

1147
01:00:12,715 --> 01:00:14,342
- What?
- Besides, isn't it obvious

1148
01:00:14,383 --> 01:00:16,374
l don't give a damn?

1149
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,645
So you two
finally hooked up, huh?

1150
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,881
What the fuck you talking about?

1151
01:00:23,926 --> 01:00:25,621
Him?

1152
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:27,390
He-- he-- he's a young filmmaker.

1153
01:00:27,429 --> 01:00:30,262
He's shooting my last day on earth.
l'm gonna shoot myself. He's my friend.

1154
01:00:31,934 --> 01:00:34,266
What the fuck's going on here?

1155
01:00:34,303 --> 01:00:36,396
Do you know her?

1156
01:00:36,438 --> 01:00:38,565
Do you know each other?

1157
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:40,871
- Carla: We've met.
- You met? When?

1158
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:43,905
Carla:
So it's suicide this time, is it, Max?

1159
01:00:43,946 --> 01:00:45,846
Oh, yeah, suicide.
Right right.

1160
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:48,008
- Yeah, suicide.
- Well, l hope you go through with it.

1161
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:49,540
Excuse me?

1162
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:51,951
- You're pathetic.
- What? l'm pathetic?

1163
01:00:51,987 --> 01:00:54,478
What? What? You want me
to congratulate you?

1164
01:00:54,523 --> 01:00:56,184
What do you want from me, Max?

1165
01:00:57,226 --> 01:01:00,491
l've wanted a lot of things from you.
A lot of things l never got.

1166
01:01:00,529 --> 01:01:03,760
But now l just want
to set things straight and that's it.

1167
01:01:05,034 --> 01:01:07,764
Just answer two questions.

1168
01:01:09,905 --> 01:01:11,896
- Okay.
- Okay?

1169
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,636
But l guarantee
you won't like the answers.

1170
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:16,268
l don't-- whatever.

1171
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:17,801
Okay.

1172
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:20,881
First question--

1173
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,214
- why did you leave me?
- Oh, God.

1174
01:01:23,252 --> 01:01:26,187
l told you the first time.

1175
01:01:26,221 --> 01:01:28,382
l wasn't happy.
lsn't that enough?

1176
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:31,552
No, it's not enough. l was unhappy too.
God damn it, it's obvious.

1177
01:01:31,593 --> 01:01:33,720
- l want to know the why--
- No, l don't think you do.

1178
01:01:33,762 --> 01:01:36,629
Well, that's for me to decide.
Tell me.

1179
01:01:36,665 --> 01:01:38,496
lf you tell me why,
then l'll-- whatever.

1180
01:01:38,534 --> 01:01:41,162
- l'll make--
- Fine, Max!

1181
01:01:41,203 --> 01:01:42,795
- Fine!
- Don't yell at me.

1182
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:44,829
But there's no nice way to put this.

1183
01:01:44,873 --> 01:01:46,932
You have never been nice.
So, don't even--- what--

1184
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:49,705
Okay okay okay okay!
The heart of the problem is

1185
01:01:49,745 --> 01:01:52,043
you're already dead.

1186
01:01:52,081 --> 01:01:54,811
- You have been for years.
- Oh, fuck you. Fuck you.

1187
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:58,684
You complain constantly, yet you never
have the guts to change anything.

1188
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,484
- You are so goddamn mean. l loved you.
- You know what, even more than that?

1189
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:03,047
- What? What?
- More important than that.

1190
01:02:03,092 --> 01:02:04,582
You basically have no purpose!

1191
01:02:04,626 --> 01:02:07,595
How the fuck could you write a novel
when you have nothing useful to say?

1192
01:02:09,264 --> 01:02:11,095
( laughs )

1193
01:02:11,133 --> 01:02:12,964
There's no point to this.
l gotta go.

1194
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:15,663
One more! You promised
you'd answer both of them.

1195
01:02:15,704 --> 01:02:17,672
l have one more question.

1196
01:02:17,706 --> 01:02:19,503
Please. Please.

1197
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,065
One more.

1198
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:23,738
Please.

1199
01:02:26,715 --> 01:02:28,205
Okay.

1200
01:02:29,785 --> 01:02:31,810
Now the second one.

1201
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:35,713
Why did you have an abortion?

1202
01:02:37,025 --> 01:02:38,993
l always wanted to have kids

1203
01:02:39,027 --> 01:02:40,790
and you knew that.

1204
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:44,823
Hmm?

1205
01:02:44,867 --> 01:02:47,392
l didn't have an abortion.

1206
01:02:47,436 --> 01:02:49,301
What? You--

1207
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,797
- You didn't?
- l went away and had a baby boy

1208
01:02:52,841 --> 01:02:54,331
and gave him up for adoption.

1209
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:55,968
You didn't have an abortion?

1210
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:57,638
You're shitting me.

1211
01:03:00,048 --> 01:03:01,709
l wasn't ready.

1212
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:09,356
Besides, it was a child
born of foolishness, not love.

1213
01:03:13,662 --> 01:03:15,562
Why didn't you tell me?

1214
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:17,758
Why didn't you--
how could you not tell me?

1215
01:03:19,334 --> 01:03:21,598
He? He?

1216
01:03:21,637 --> 01:03:23,298
You said he?
A baby boy?

1217
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:25,033
( voice cracking )
So, l have a son?

1218
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:26,904
You didn't tell--

1219
01:03:30,479 --> 01:03:32,606
Yes, you have a son.

1220
01:03:43,091 --> 01:03:45,719
Do you have any idea where he is?
Do you know where he might be?

1221
01:03:48,096 --> 01:03:50,792
- Do you have-- do you know where he is?
- ( crying )

1222
01:03:51,934 --> 01:03:54,164
l'd like to maybe meet him,
but-- don't cry.

1223
01:03:54,203 --> 01:03:55,932
l-- l'm sorry.

1224
01:03:55,971 --> 01:03:58,064
l'd like to maybe meet him

1225
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:00,301
and to know him.

1226
01:04:02,978 --> 01:04:05,208
He's filming you right now.

1227
01:04:07,583 --> 01:04:11,110
- Him?
- ( sniffs )

1228
01:04:11,153 --> 01:04:12,950
He didn't tell you.
That's crazy.

1229
01:04:15,057 --> 01:04:17,082
Him, no.

1230
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,593
You ask me who your father is
and you don't tell him the truth?

1231
01:04:30,739 --> 01:04:32,764
- Here he is, Max.
- What?

1232
01:04:32,808 --> 01:04:34,901
Let me introduce you
to your son.

1233
01:04:49,424 --> 01:04:52,587
- You two are unbelievable.
- l'm sorry.

1234
01:04:55,731 --> 01:04:58,131
Two of a kind,
father and son for sure.

1235
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:04,132
Max, l'm sorry.

1236
01:05:10,912 --> 01:05:12,675
l did what l thought was right.

1237
01:05:12,714 --> 01:05:14,944
Okay.

1238
01:05:14,983 --> 01:05:17,042
lt's in the past and that's
where l want to keep it.

1239
01:05:17,085 --> 01:05:19,280
l hope you both
understand that. Good night.

1240
01:05:22,658 --> 01:05:24,683
Carla, l always loved you.

1241
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:37,800
Good luck with the suicide.

1242
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,898
Let me know how it works out.

1243
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,383
Hey, look who's here.

1244
01:05:57,426 --> 01:05:58,950
What the fuck do you want?

1245
01:05:58,994 --> 01:06:00,962
Who are you?
Who are you?

1246
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,431
l'm just someone who wanted
to wish you a happy Father's Day.

1247
01:06:07,402 --> 01:06:09,199
Motherfucker!

1248
01:06:09,237 --> 01:06:11,296
- ( Max grunting )
- ( veteran laughing )

1249
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,807
Go on, Max!

1250
01:06:12,841 --> 01:06:16,709
l told you, Max. The man who
has a gun will eventually use it.

1251
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:18,406
Who the fuck are you?

1252
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:19,914
- ( laughing )
- Bud: Let's go.

1253
01:06:19,948 --> 01:06:21,848
l think you know who l am, Max.

1254
01:06:32,027 --> 01:06:35,656
Forget about that crazy bastard.
l mean, they're all over the city.

1255
01:06:40,268 --> 01:06:42,293
l want you to know
that l never meant to hurt you.

1256
01:06:43,872 --> 01:06:45,396
There was just never a good time.

1257
01:06:46,842 --> 01:06:48,571
l'm really sorry.

1258
01:06:59,788 --> 01:07:02,951
- l know.
- ( lounge music playing )

1259
01:07:02,991 --> 01:07:04,754
You're gonna think
this is crazy, but...

1260
01:07:06,094 --> 01:07:07,959
l started to follow you.

1261
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:11,255
Getting familiar
with your daily habits.

1262
01:07:11,299 --> 01:07:13,665
l looked you up on the net,
found out that you had written

1263
01:07:13,702 --> 01:07:15,499
a couple graphic novels
in the '90s.

1264
01:07:15,537 --> 01:07:17,505
So l looked those up,
tracked those down.

1265
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:23,277
lt was a reason to start
a conversation with you.

1266
01:07:24,646 --> 01:07:26,136
Oh, yeah.

1267
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:30,278
l'm sorry that you
had to find the truth that way.

1268
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,281
- ( crying ) But the truth is--
- Shh.

1269
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:37,782
l didn't have the courage.

1270
01:07:39,394 --> 01:07:41,294
- l was scared.
- Of course.

1271
01:07:44,132 --> 01:07:46,293
l'm sorry.

1272
01:07:46,334 --> 01:07:47,961
Stop.

1273
01:07:49,004 --> 01:07:50,801
- Don't-- don't--
- You must hate me.

1274
01:07:52,274 --> 01:07:53,764
No.

1275
01:07:56,912 --> 01:07:58,573
Hey.

1276
01:08:00,048 --> 01:08:02,516
No more crying, okay?

1277
01:08:02,551 --> 01:08:04,143
Just do me a favor.

1278
01:08:06,054 --> 01:08:07,646
You're my son.

1279
01:08:09,691 --> 01:08:11,625
Wow, huh?

1280
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,925
You just forget it.
You forget about all of it.

1281
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:18,057
Fuck it. Okay?

1282
01:08:18,099 --> 01:08:20,192
lt's a time for celebration.

1283
01:08:20,235 --> 01:08:22,328
- Yeah.
- l just met my son.

1284
01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:39,378
You gonna let me in
on where we're going?

1285
01:08:41,456 --> 01:08:43,754
l'd rather not, okay?

1286
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:46,022
Okay, look, time to expose

1287
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:49,360
the secret underbelly
of your dear old dad's life.

1288
01:08:49,397 --> 01:08:51,126
- Okay?
- You're addicted to Chinese?

1289
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:54,101
Wow. Yeah, in a sense.

1290
01:08:54,135 --> 01:08:55,727
( laughs )

1291
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,362
There's no way
to put this politely,

1292
01:08:57,405 --> 01:08:59,965
but we are going to a place that is
commonly referred to in certain circles

1293
01:09:00,008 --> 01:09:02,374
as a house of ill-repute,
a bordello,

1294
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:04,378
- a brothel, a whorehouse...
- Oh, no.

1295
01:09:04,412 --> 01:09:07,245
- ...a knocking shop.
- Okay, l am not filming that.

1296
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,911
- But why?
- Oh, no.

1297
01:09:10,952 --> 01:09:14,353
What? Shocked to find out
that father is a man?

1298
01:09:14,389 --> 01:09:16,050
Huh?

1299
01:09:16,091 --> 01:09:19,151
Look, l'm just going there to talk to
one of the girls and that's all, okay?

1300
01:09:19,194 --> 01:09:21,662
- Okay.
- And if you'd like,

1301
01:09:21,696 --> 01:09:24,164
l could treat you.

1302
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:26,030
- l think l'll give it a miss.
- Okay.

1303
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:27,830
Save me some dough.

1304
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:29,427
Thanks for the offer.

1305
01:09:39,014 --> 01:09:40,572
Man:
Turn that off.

1306
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:44,717
lt's okay. He's filming me, not you.
Don't worry about it.

1307
01:09:44,753 --> 01:09:46,380
l don't care.
Turn that off.

1308
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:48,082
You don't care?
Turn it off.

1309
01:09:50,559 --> 01:09:52,823
Asshole.

1310
01:09:52,861 --> 01:09:55,125
Oh my God. Melinda?

1311
01:09:56,464 --> 01:09:58,159
l had no idea.
When did this happen?

1312
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:02,464
Oh, come on, talk to me. lt's not like
we don't know each other, please.

1313
01:10:02,504 --> 01:10:05,996
You know what? You didn't come down
here to speak to a cripple, did you?

1314
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:08,908
That's-- you-- you're wrong.
l came here only to see you.

1315
01:10:08,944 --> 01:10:11,777
- Yeah, whatever.
- Look, today's a special day for me.

1316
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:14,782
l-- l-- l-- l made a pledge
to stop lying to myself

1317
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:16,716
and to stop lying to other people.

1318
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:18,582
l always thought that
we could-- we would--

1319
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,485
if we weren't,
we could become friends.

1320
01:10:21,756 --> 01:10:23,690
Let me-- let me
take you away from here.

1321
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:26,023
- l'm waiting for somebody.
- We'll get a drink.

1322
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:27,619
- What?
- No.

1323
01:10:27,662 --> 01:10:30,187
l'm waiting for my husband Mikhail.

1324
01:10:33,635 --> 01:10:35,762
Your husband?
You're kidding me.

1325
01:10:38,106 --> 01:10:39,903
l didn't know you were married.

1326
01:10:39,941 --> 01:10:41,932
Does he know you're out here?

1327
01:10:41,977 --> 01:10:44,377
- Yeah.
- Max: How does he stand it?

1328
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:45,970
How does he take it?

1329
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:52,517
You know, why don't you just
go upstairs and get some pussy?

1330
01:10:52,554 --> 01:10:54,351
That is, if you can get it up.

1331
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,957
Max: l see.

1332
01:10:59,995 --> 01:11:02,361
l see how it is now, huh?

1333
01:11:03,431 --> 01:11:05,331
You know what?
Fuck you.

1334
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:06,891
- Bitch.
- Max.

1335
01:11:06,935 --> 01:11:08,493
Wait. Buddy, wait here.

1336
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:10,026
- l'll be right back.
- What?

1337
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:11,902
Open the door.

1338
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,824
He's telling the truth, you know.

1339
01:11:37,265 --> 01:11:38,960
He came here to say
goodbye to you.

1340
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:45,402
Why?
Where's he going?

1341
01:11:48,576 --> 01:11:51,238
( chuckles )
How do l put this?

1342
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:52,644
Um...

1343
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,285
l'm not filming
a day in the life.

1344
01:12:00,588 --> 01:12:02,749
lt's the last day in the life.

1345
01:12:05,593 --> 01:12:07,288
l don't understand.

1346
01:12:12,867 --> 01:12:14,494
He's done.

1347
01:12:16,404 --> 01:12:18,269
Okay.

1348
01:12:18,306 --> 01:12:21,207
He's had enough.
He plans to kill himself tonight.

1349
01:12:21,242 --> 01:12:23,437
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

1350
01:12:29,117 --> 01:12:31,381
l don't know how to stop him.

1351
01:12:31,419 --> 01:12:33,444
But, listen,

1352
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:35,581
l know Max.

1353
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:37,648
He may not be a great man,
but he's got--

1354
01:12:39,127 --> 01:12:42,290
l-- there's some good in him anyway.
l've seen it.

1355
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:45,493
So if you're his friend,
you have to stop him, okay?

1356
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:47,330
l'm not his friend.

1357
01:12:49,504 --> 01:12:51,335
l'm his son.

1358
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,577
l've given everything that l can.

1359
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:01,306
l--

1360
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:05,580
if l just can ride it out...

1361
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:08,747
l figure if l can keep him talking

1362
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:10,621
and keep him drinking...

1363
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:14,987
then he won't be able
to pull the trigger.

1364
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:16,690
That's all l can think of.

1365
01:13:24,272 --> 01:13:26,001
lt's okay.

1366
01:13:27,876 --> 01:13:29,639
- ( buckle rattling )
- Come on, no.

1367
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:33,076
No.

1368
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,945
Shh. So, um--

1369
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:38,475
How can you do this?

1370
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,147
How can you do this really?

1371
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:41,746
How do you do it?

1372
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:45,123
l'm sorry, l don't understand.

1373
01:13:47,128 --> 01:13:50,154
Really? Okay.
Why don't you sit down for a while?

1374
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:51,756
l just want to talk, okay?

1375
01:13:58,039 --> 01:13:59,870
l just want to talk for a while.

1376
01:13:59,908 --> 01:14:01,432
Sure.

1377
01:14:01,476 --> 01:14:03,239
Whatever pleases you.

1378
01:14:03,278 --> 01:14:05,746
Listen, would you cut the--
stop fucking with me.

1379
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,407
Just cut the bullshit,
all right, home girl?

1380
01:14:07,448 --> 01:14:09,439
All right? l'm just
not in the mood, all right?

1381
01:14:09,484 --> 01:14:11,384
l'm begging you.

1382
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:18,786
lt's your hour.
Spend it however you want.

1383
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:20,522
l know.
l've done it before.

1384
01:14:20,562 --> 01:14:22,257
l know the rules.

1385
01:14:24,299 --> 01:14:26,062
Aw, fuck it.

1386
01:14:30,605 --> 01:14:32,300
Look...

1387
01:14:33,675 --> 01:14:36,075
l'm sorry.

1388
01:14:38,179 --> 01:14:39,771
What for?

1389
01:14:43,318 --> 01:14:44,876
Truthfully, l don't know.

1390
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:47,387
But-- look,

1391
01:14:47,422 --> 01:14:49,652
good luck with your life.

1392
01:14:53,161 --> 01:14:54,719
Hey, honey...

1393
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:59,494
where do you think Melin--
where is Melinda's husband?

1394
01:14:59,534 --> 01:15:01,229
- Do you know?
- ( laughs )

1395
01:15:05,473 --> 01:15:08,033
For just a brief moment,
a fleeting moment,

1396
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:10,670
there was a spark
of romance between us.

1397
01:15:10,712 --> 01:15:12,612
l'm just bullshitting you.
You're a charmer.

1398
01:15:12,647 --> 01:15:14,274
Which room is he in, huh?

1399
01:15:18,286 --> 01:15:20,948
- Which room is he in?
- Room 1 2.

1400
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:23,014
- Thank you.
- Two doors down.

1401
01:15:23,057 --> 01:15:24,615
l know where it is.

1402
01:15:33,468 --> 01:15:35,095
Oh, wow.
Um, excuse me.

1403
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:37,036
l don't want to interrupt, but--

1404
01:15:37,071 --> 01:15:39,039
- What the fuck?
- ls that your wife

1405
01:15:39,073 --> 01:15:41,007
in the wheelchair outside?
Your wife.

1406
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:43,704
- ls that-- in the wheelchair outside?
- Fucker!

1407
01:15:43,745 --> 01:15:46,179
( grunting, yelling )

1408
01:15:46,214 --> 01:15:47,772
You talk to me about my wife?!

1409
01:15:47,815 --> 01:15:50,045
( grunting, groaning )

1410
01:15:58,459 --> 01:16:01,121
Sasha!
( shouting in Russian )

1411
01:16:01,162 --> 01:16:03,687
( screaming )

1412
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:09,930
- Ow!
- Jesus Christ.

1413
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:12,405
lt's me. Jesus,
what happened to your face?

1414
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,874
- ( moaning )
- Here.

1415
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,843
- Stop.
- Don't worry.

1416
01:16:19,314 --> 01:16:21,179
Jesus.
Here, sit down.

1417
01:16:22,984 --> 01:16:25,043
- Sit down here.
- ( clattering )

1418
01:16:26,888 --> 01:16:29,550
- What happened?
- l met your husband.

1419
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,387
He's a real nice guy.

1420
01:16:31,426 --> 01:16:33,519
Okay, it's time to go.

1421
01:16:33,561 --> 01:16:35,290
We're going, come on.

1422
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:37,093
Bud. Bud.

1423
01:16:38,132 --> 01:16:40,862
- Let's have that drink.
- Max: Oh, that's okay.

1424
01:16:40,902 --> 01:16:43,029
That's okay.

1425
01:16:43,071 --> 01:16:44,561
You're right about me.

1426
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:46,937
You're right about everything.
lt was all my fault.

1427
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:50,404
l guess l just couldn't
understand how someone could--

1428
01:16:50,445 --> 01:16:52,675
someone could leave someone
like you out here in this--

1429
01:16:52,714 --> 01:16:54,341
this goddamn shitstorm.

1430
01:16:54,382 --> 01:16:56,316
- lt's okay.
- That's all.

1431
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:58,581
Let's go.

1432
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:00,348
Yeah, we're-- let's go
to her place for a drink.

1433
01:17:00,388 --> 01:17:02,356
Melinda:
Yeah. Okay?

1434
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:03,880
Moving on, Buddy.

1435
01:17:04,926 --> 01:17:07,759
Are you really going
through with it tonight?

1436
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:11,287
You're gonna walk me to my apartment,
have a drink and then

1437
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:13,527
go home and pull the trigger?
ls that right?

1438
01:17:13,568 --> 01:17:15,468
Aw, fuck you.

1439
01:17:15,503 --> 01:17:17,801
Yeah, don't--
don't mock me, please.

1440
01:17:17,839 --> 01:17:20,740
All right, whatever.
Yes, that's what l'm going to do.

1441
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:25,543
- Sorry.
- That's okay. l'm up here on the left.

1442
01:17:27,849 --> 01:17:30,079
Max, come on.

1443
01:17:30,118 --> 01:17:31,881
Come on, let's have
that drink, okay?

1444
01:17:33,087 --> 01:17:34,884
What about your husband?

1445
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:37,049
- Huh?
- Well, since you interrupted him,

1446
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:39,389
l'm-- l'm sure he'll
be busy for hours.

1447
01:17:46,801 --> 01:17:49,167
Max:
Cheers.

1448
01:17:51,472 --> 01:17:54,737
Melinda, l don't
want to upset you,

1449
01:17:54,776 --> 01:17:56,471
but, l mean...

1450
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:01,014
for God's sake,
what happened here?

1451
01:18:01,049 --> 01:18:03,279
There was an accident.
l fell down some stairs.

1452
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:05,512
Well, that's funny.
Funny you should say that.

1453
01:18:05,553 --> 01:18:08,147
l-- l fell down some
stairs tonight myself.

1454
01:18:10,558 --> 01:18:13,220
What difference does it make?
l'm still in this chair.

1455
01:18:15,396 --> 01:18:17,330
ls he the reason? Huh?

1456
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,863
Mikhail?

1457
01:18:20,902 --> 01:18:22,893
- Did he do it?
- Are you asking me

1458
01:18:22,937 --> 01:18:25,132
- did he throw me down the stairs?
- Yes, l am.

1459
01:18:26,574 --> 01:18:28,906
The answer is yes, but...

1460
01:18:30,445 --> 01:18:34,006
l did it to myself.
l was out of my mind. l was high.

1461
01:18:34,048 --> 01:18:37,279
Furious with him for nothing
and we were fighting like animals

1462
01:18:37,318 --> 01:18:40,014
and l-- l don't think
either of us really

1463
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:41,988
knew what was happening.
And then l--

1464
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,355
and then, the next thing l...

1465
01:18:48,396 --> 01:18:51,422
knew l was--

1466
01:18:51,466 --> 01:18:53,058
l was in intensive care.

1467
01:18:54,102 --> 01:18:56,935
And that's it. That's it.

1468
01:18:56,971 --> 01:18:58,666
l'm sorry.

1469
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:04,374
Come on, you know what,
we all make choices.

1470
01:19:04,412 --> 01:19:06,778
And l'm-- l'm no more
of a victim than you are.

1471
01:19:10,985 --> 01:19:13,579
What?

1472
01:19:13,621 --> 01:19:15,953
- Do you want some ice for that?
- No no no no.

1473
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:19,884
l'm fine, really.

1474
01:19:21,629 --> 01:19:23,961
Whoa, three in a row.

1475
01:19:23,998 --> 01:19:25,329
( sighs )

1476
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:28,801
- You're bleeding.
- Oh, no no no no.

1477
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:30,463
Honey, don't worry.
lt's not mine.

1478
01:19:30,505 --> 01:19:32,234
ls-- is it Mikhail's?

1479
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:35,976
Oh, how l wish it was.

1480
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:37,534
But no.

1481
01:19:37,578 --> 01:19:39,307
Um, Bud and l, uh--

1482
01:19:39,347 --> 01:19:41,975
we had an accident
earlier this evening.

1483
01:19:42,016 --> 01:19:43,881
Right?

1484
01:19:43,918 --> 01:19:47,149
l don't understand, Max.

1485
01:19:47,188 --> 01:19:50,089
Um, as this was--

1486
01:19:50,124 --> 01:19:52,888
this is my last day
here on earth,

1487
01:19:52,927 --> 01:19:54,588
l decided to set
some things straight.

1488
01:19:54,629 --> 01:19:57,462
So l went to see my boss, right?

1489
01:19:57,498 --> 01:20:01,366
And, um, well, l just
wanted him to say he's sorry,

1490
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:03,962
- but he wouldn't.
- Okay.

1491
01:20:04,005 --> 01:20:05,199
So he came at me

1492
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:07,537
and we struggled
and l threatened him with this.

1493
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:09,236
- ( Melinda gasps )
- And it went off.

1494
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:14,373
And...

1495
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:16,007
that's what happened.

1496
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:19,076
- Did you, um--
- Hmm?

1497
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,644
- Did you kill him?
- Yes.

1498
01:20:20,688 --> 01:20:22,656
Hmm? Right?

1499
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,920
Max:
Did l? Yeah, yes.

1500
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,928
Look, l didn't want it to happen,

1501
01:20:27,962 --> 01:20:30,294
but he's gone, okay?

1502
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:31,992
So what does it matter?

1503
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:33,933
And l'll be gone too very soon

1504
01:20:33,968 --> 01:20:35,993
- before they catch up to me.
- What kind of man are you?

1505
01:20:36,037 --> 01:20:37,527
- What?
- What kind of man are you?

1506
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:39,506
l'm the kind of man
who wishes he was dead!

1507
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,338
Okay?
Why would l lie to you now?

1508
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:45,470
Accident or not, there's no sense
in you taking your own life.

1509
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:47,481
And what about your son?

1510
01:20:47,515 --> 01:20:49,642
- What about him?
- He needs you.

1511
01:20:51,652 --> 01:20:53,142
- No he doesn't.
- Yes, he does.

1512
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:55,917
No he doesn't.
He needs--

1513
01:20:55,957 --> 01:20:58,824
- he needs a father.
- Melinda: Bud. Bud.

1514
01:21:00,595 --> 01:21:02,563
- What do you say?
- Max: Bud?

1515
01:21:02,597 --> 01:21:04,462
- ( crying )
- Oh, Bud, come on.

1516
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:06,227
Buddy, Buddy, Buddy,
come on.

1517
01:21:06,267 --> 01:21:08,098
- No.
- Buddy, it's okay, come on.

1518
01:21:08,135 --> 01:21:10,103
Come on, it's okay. lt's okay.

1519
01:21:10,137 --> 01:21:12,105
Hey, look, listen to me.
Listen to me.

1520
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:14,300
Hey hey hey.
For you--

1521
01:21:14,342 --> 01:21:16,401
for my son,
l can change my mind.

1522
01:21:16,444 --> 01:21:19,345
- l can change my mind.
- You mean it?

1523
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,780
Yes, l mean it.
Buddy, Buddy, listen--

1524
01:21:21,816 --> 01:21:23,374
look at me, l mean it.

1525
01:21:24,418 --> 01:21:27,785
Okay? Turn the camera off, okay?
Would you?

1526
01:21:27,822 --> 01:21:30,188
- Turn the camera off.
- Promise me.

1527
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:32,920
l promise.
Turn the camera off, okay, Buddy?

1528
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,428
l promise. l promise.

1529
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:43,229
l promise.

1530
01:21:43,271 --> 01:21:44,761
Max:
All right?

1531
01:21:44,805 --> 01:21:48,138
l know l took you
on quite a ride today.

1532
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:49,699
- And l'm so--
- You could say that.

1533
01:21:49,744 --> 01:21:51,541
Buddy, Buddy--
Bud, l'm sorry.

1534
01:21:52,713 --> 01:21:54,374
l'm sorry for everything.

1535
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:59,044
- For everything.
- lt's okay.

1536
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:01,145
Why don't you just go home?
Just go home.

1537
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:03,156
( crying )
Why don't you just go home?

1538
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,249
l'm sorry.
Just go home, okay?

1539
01:22:05,293 --> 01:22:07,352
Here's the keys and l'll just--

1540
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:09,260
l have to talk to her
and l'll be right behind you.

1541
01:22:09,297 --> 01:22:11,060
l'll be along in a while, okay?

1542
01:22:13,968 --> 01:22:15,663
Look, why don't l--
give me the gun.

1543
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,193
- Nope.
- You don't need it.

1544
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:19,536
You gotta trust me.
You need to trust me.

1545
01:22:19,573 --> 01:22:22,167
All right?
You gotta trust me.

1546
01:22:22,209 --> 01:22:24,541
- Why don't you let me take the gun?
- Bud, trust me.

1547
01:22:24,578 --> 01:22:26,603
lt would make me feel better.

1548
01:22:26,647 --> 01:22:29,013
Trust me, Buddy,
on this one, okay?

1549
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,644
Why don't you just go home?

1550
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:33,551
l'll, you know--

1551
01:22:33,587 --> 01:22:36,681
l'll be right-- just meet me
at my place later.

1552
01:22:36,724 --> 01:22:38,351
Everything's gonna be all right.

1553
01:22:38,392 --> 01:22:40,451
l promise.

1554
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:42,223
Okay?

1555
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:46,389
- l promise.
- See you at home.

1556
01:22:46,434 --> 01:22:48,231
- Max: Okay.
- lt was nice to meet you, Bud.

1557
01:22:51,839 --> 01:22:53,363
lt was nice to meet you too.

1558
01:22:53,407 --> 01:22:55,136
( door opening )

1559
01:22:57,511 --> 01:23:00,844
He's-- he's a nice boy, huh?

1560
01:23:02,516 --> 01:23:04,108
Yeah.

1561
01:23:05,353 --> 01:23:06,945
( crying )

1562
01:23:21,268 --> 01:23:23,293
Melinda:
Why don't you sit down?

1563
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:25,168
Max:
Thanks, but l think l should go.

1564
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,369
l'm going to--

1565
01:23:30,678 --> 01:23:32,407
( sighs )

1566
01:23:32,446 --> 01:23:34,380
l'm going to

1567
01:23:34,415 --> 01:23:36,315
finish what l set out to do.

1568
01:23:38,886 --> 01:23:41,047
You can't do that to your son.
You promised him.

1569
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,352
Think about it.

1570
01:23:43,391 --> 01:23:45,951
Look at me, Melinda.

1571
01:23:45,993 --> 01:23:48,461
l'm a wounded dog.

1572
01:23:48,496 --> 01:23:50,259
l am.

1573
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:55,792
lt'd be better for everybody
if l just put an end to it.

1574
01:23:56,837 --> 01:24:00,170
And besides, how long before the police
are knocking my door down?

1575
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:02,732
lf l don't die tonight,
l'll die in prison six months from now.

1576
01:24:02,777 --> 01:24:04,506
Either way, it's over.
So at least this way--

1577
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:07,173
- No.
- l have some control over how it ends.

1578
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:10,377
No. Can't you see you're blessed
to have that boy in your life?

1579
01:24:11,485 --> 01:24:14,477
l can see how much he loves you
just by looking at him.

1580
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:20,286
- ( crying )
- Come on.

1581
01:24:20,327 --> 01:24:21,851
- l can't take it anymore.
- Yes, you can.

1582
01:24:21,896 --> 01:24:23,454
- l'm a coward.
- No, you're not.

1583
01:24:23,497 --> 01:24:25,226
- l can't take anymore.
- Come on.

1584
01:24:27,301 --> 01:24:30,498
l'm slowly day to day
turning into a cripple.

1585
01:24:32,206 --> 01:24:33,764
l don't know what to do.

1586
01:24:33,808 --> 01:24:35,537
l don't know where to go.

1587
01:24:40,014 --> 01:24:41,948
l'm sorry.

1588
01:24:41,982 --> 01:24:44,780
- l didn't mean to--
- l know. l know.

1589
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:46,446
Max:
Oh, shit, l'm sorry.

1590
01:24:46,487 --> 01:24:48,387
Melinda:
Come on, Max.

1591
01:24:55,629 --> 01:24:57,859
Max:
Can l ask you something?

1592
01:24:58,999 --> 01:25:01,365
Why-- why do you
stay with him?

1593
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:05,829
Melinda, look at me.

1594
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:08,103
l want to know--
look at me.

1595
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:11,943
You know what he is.

1596
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:13,776
And how could--
why do you stay with him?

1597
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:22,680
Where else am l gonna go?

1598
01:25:26,727 --> 01:25:28,627
l'm sorry, it's--

1599
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:35,598
l can't help you either.

1600
01:25:55,256 --> 01:25:58,623
Do you know this chair
is breaking my fucking heart?

1601
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,183
lt's okay.

1602
01:26:00,227 --> 01:26:02,889
l just want to tell you that--

1603
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:04,420
that-- that's all.

1604
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:07,425
- l'm sorry.
- lt's all right.

1605
01:26:07,468 --> 01:26:09,129
- Hey, hey.
- l'm okay.

1606
01:26:10,804 --> 01:26:12,704
- Hey.
- l'm okay.

1607
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,948
Melinda:
lt's okay.

1608
01:26:35,563 --> 01:26:37,190
Son of a bitch.

1609
01:26:37,231 --> 01:26:39,563
- Fuck!
- No no no!

1610
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,864
- Max: No! No! No!
- Bud: Shit!

1611
01:26:41,902 --> 01:26:43,426
- ( tires screeching )
- ( grunting )

1612
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,699
- You son of a bitch!
- ( Max choking )

1613
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:53,947
( Bud panting )

1614
01:26:57,685 --> 01:27:01,382
- Max: Motherfucker!
- Get him out of here!

1615
01:27:01,422 --> 01:27:03,481
Take his tie off,
put it on him, hurry up!

1616
01:27:04,692 --> 01:27:06,990
Melinda:
Do it! Do it now!

1617
01:27:07,027 --> 01:27:09,325
Ow! Fucking tie.

1618
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:14,062
Get his gun.
Put it in his hand.

1619
01:27:16,604 --> 01:27:19,004
Max. Max. Max!

1620
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:20,529
What?

1621
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:22,542
- You shot him.
- Hit me.

1622
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:24,168
Max:
What?

1623
01:27:25,212 --> 01:27:27,407
- What?
- lf you care about me

1624
01:27:27,448 --> 01:27:29,916
at all, you will punch me

1625
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:32,714
as hard as you can right now.

1626
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:42,987
Again!

1627
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:45,260
- Max: What?
- Again! Do it again! Harder!

1628
01:27:48,636 --> 01:27:50,399
( crying )

1629
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:53,736
How many times
could l let him beat me?

1630
01:27:56,343 --> 01:27:57,833
He's got a record a mile long

1631
01:27:57,878 --> 01:28:00,438
and your boss
is just another customer.

1632
01:28:00,481 --> 01:28:02,312
Look, Mikhail's a dealer.
He's a thug.

1633
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:05,948
He's a killer.

1634
01:28:07,988 --> 01:28:10,286
Melinda:
No one will ask any questions.

1635
01:28:10,324 --> 01:28:12,485
What's going on?

1636
01:28:12,526 --> 01:28:15,051
lt's self-defense,
nothing more.

1637
01:28:15,095 --> 01:28:17,256
What were we doing?

1638
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:19,162
- ( sirens wailing )
- Shit!

1639
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:20,962
- We gotta go.
- What?

1640
01:28:21,001 --> 01:28:23,731
- Bud: Dad, we gotta--
- Melinda: Go. Max!

1641
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:27,070
l've given you back your life.
Don't you fucking dare waste it.

1642
01:28:27,107 --> 01:28:29,098
Bud:
We gotta go! Come on!

1643
01:28:36,483 --> 01:28:38,246
Let's go!

1644
01:29:41,014 --> 01:29:42,675
Fuck.
